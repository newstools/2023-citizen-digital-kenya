A Mombasa Court on Friday sentenced
seven foreign sailors to life imprisonment after they were found guilty of
trafficking heroin worth Ksh.1.3 billion into Mombasa via the Indian Ocean. The six Pakistanis and one
Iranian are; Yousuf Yakoob, Yakoob Ibrahim, Saleem Muhammad, Bhatti Abdul
Ghafour, Baksh Moula, Pak Abdolghaffer and Muhammed Saleh. The accused, who have likewise
been ordered to pay Ksh.3.9 billion in fines, have been given 14 days to appeal
the verdict issued by  Mombasa chief
magistrate Martha Mutuku. The accused, who were crew
members of the Amin Darya ship, also known as Al Noor, were arrested aboard the
vessel in 2014, while the ship was at sea. They claimed to have been
ferrying white cement to Zanzibar. A police search would later
reveal that the ship was ferrying 377 kilograms of granular heroin, 33,200
litres of liquid heroin and 2,400 litres of diesel mixed with heroin. The ship was later blown up 33
kilometers away from the Mombasa port in an operation overseen by former
President Uhuru Kenyatta who then reiterated that Kenya would not condone the
trafficking of drugs via its borders. During the trial, the accused persons
claimed that Kenyan authorities meddled with investigations by destroying the
ship before their case was concluded but magistrate Mutuku noted that the court
was content with the  evidence recovered
from the vessel before it was sunk.  “This
was supported by the accused who said that they saw police office retrieve some
substance, I see no reason why the drugs would be planted by security
agencies,” said Mutuku in her ruling.
