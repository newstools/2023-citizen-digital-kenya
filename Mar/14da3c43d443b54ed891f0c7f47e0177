 According to DP Gachagua, a number of former ministers and Principal Secretaries (PSs) were receiving money packaged in sacks at their homes using planes from the Wilson Airport. Speaking during a thanksgiving service at Jesus Winner Ministry in Roysambu on Sunday, the second in command claimed that in the coming days, he will be unmasking the individuals behind his alleged sentiments. "These people robbed the nation. In the next few days I will be releasing details of billions of shillings looted from public coffers in the last three months of the Uhuru administration and announce the ministers and PSs responsible so that Kenyans can know," said DP Gachagua. "At the police airwing in Wilson Airport is where money was being brought in sacks, packed into the planes, and taken to different homes." Furthering his attack on "those fellows who kept on shouting that they cannot hand over to thieves", DP Gachagua claimed that there was a deliberate plan to lodge the presidential results petition before the Supreme Court to create time for more stealing. "When they saw the election is not in their favor they looted public money with sacks. They knew the case would not amount to anything it was just there to allow them to steal and then go," stated the Deputy President. "Even the petition they took to Supreme Court was forced on 'mzee wa maandamano' to allow them room to steal money while the court was listening to the case between the time IEBC announced William Ruto as President and the day he was sworn in they looted more than Ksh.24 billion." DP Gachagua added that he will not cower from "telling Kenyans the truth" and will be at the forefront of laying bare the truth on how public money was squandered.
