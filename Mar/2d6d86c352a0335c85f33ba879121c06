 Addressing the media after a closed-door meeting with security agencies, the county leadership and other stakeholders, the committee led by Runyenjes MP Erick Muchangi disclosed that none of the victims had come forward to record statements in regard to the incident. “The fact that no one has come forward to report to the DCI or to the parliamentary committee on labour has to do with the fear of losing their jobs and livelihoods, especially in the tough economic times the country faces,” said Mr Muchangi. He however assured that the government has the capacity to get to the bottom of the scandal and bring the culprits to book. “The government of Kenya has the capacity to investigate and find out exactly who the suspects are, how long the exploitation has been going on, and bring the suspects to book,” he said. Kericho Woman Representative Beatrice Kimei besieged the women who testified in the BBC documentary claiming to have been sexually exploited to come out and record statements to aid in the investigations. Kimei assured the women of their security, pointing out that they would be protected and none of them would be victimised. Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Noordin Haji last month asked the National Police Service (NPS) to commence investigations into alleged cases of rape and sexual assault at the two companies. Haji's directive followed a recent investigative report by BBC Africa titled " Sex for Work: The True Cost of Our Tea," in which two female casual labourers claimed to have been forced to sleep with high-ranking officials at the said companies in order to be absorbed into their respective workforces. "These grave allegations are contrary to sections 4, 5, 6, 23(1), and 26 of the Sexual Offences Act as well as Section 6 (1) of the Kenya Employment Act," said Haji in a Wednesday letter addressed to Police IG Japhet Koome. James Finlay Kenya has since suspended two contractors after they were exposed in the BBC report.
