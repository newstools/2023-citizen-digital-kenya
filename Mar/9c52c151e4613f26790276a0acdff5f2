 The MPs led by Edwin Sifuna said Ruto led administration has been pointing fingers to the past regime instead of tackling the teething issues affecting ordinary Kenyans such as high cost of living. The legislators also took issues with the borrowing spree by the national govt, an idea which they vehemently opposed during their campaigns. The leaders have said they will not relent on their bid to push on the govt for accountability on  how they are  currently utilizing the tax payers' money which they say is being misappropriated. They were addressing the press at the ODM party headquarters this afternoon.
