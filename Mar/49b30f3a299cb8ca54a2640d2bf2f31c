 The two shooting victims are the deceased officer's wife and a colleague's spouse, whom he is said to have shot twice after excusing himself from patrol duty to 'pick something from his house'. According to a police report filed at the Langata Police Station, the officer then locked himself inside his house before shooting his 28-year-old girlfriend seven times on Sunday at 9 p.m. According to officers who responded to the scene, the officer died as a result of a self-inflicted gunshot that entered his neck from the front and exited from the back. According to an eyewitness who spoke to Citizen.Digital after the incident, the suspect involved in the shooting had appeared troubled recently; it is unknown what prompted the shooting. The scene was visited by Langata subcounty police commander Monica Kimani who declined to discuss the shocking incident. Meanwhile, Bomas area senior assistant chief Charles Awino said the incident is linked to internal issues within the camp. The three bodies have been moved to the city mortuary pending further investigations.
