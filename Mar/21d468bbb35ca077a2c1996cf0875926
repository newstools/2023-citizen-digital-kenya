 While dismissing the petition filed by Hussein Tuneya Dado, justice Njoki Mwangi said the electoral commission IEBC conducted the polls in a free, fair and credible manner. Justice Njoki thus ruled that the petition does not meet the threshold for nullification. In her ruling, the judge noted that the Tana River elections were held in accordance with the provisions of the constitution and all the electoral laws save for a few human errors which she said did not materially affect the outcome of the election. Governor Dhadho was declared the winner after garnering 26, 892 votes against Hussein Tuneya Dado's 26, 633 votes.
