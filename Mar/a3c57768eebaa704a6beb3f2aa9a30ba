 Governor Kiarie Badilisha will not have new COâ€™s soon to replace those he inherited from his predecessor Francis Kimemia. The 14 officers will wait a little longer as the court is set to determine their eligibility. Speaker Stephen Wachira Waiganjo on Tuesday informed the Assembly that he was in possession of a court order dated February 28 that requires that the vetting process be halted until a matter that has been filed by one George Kinuthia is heard and determined. He noted that the office of the clerk had received a Court order emanating from the ELRC petition number E003-2023 that restrain the governor from appointing the various nominees to the respective offices as well as training the nominees for taking up office, taking up functions or duties that would ordinarily be performed by the holder of the offices. The matter is set to be heard Tuesday (today) Virtually before Justice David Nderitu sitting in Nakuru Employment and Labour Relations Court. The petition has not been well received by the Governor, who has expressed his fury over some individuals who are always opposed to anything his administration is set to undertake. He regretted that recently he sought to raise a bursary kitty but some residents moved to court to oppose the Finance Bill and before this was settled, he was served with another court order to halt the recruitment of new government officers. However, he said he would not look back and instead would push on in putting into place his development agenda. He said his plans were clear and called on residents from Nyandarua to give him time to realize and implement his agenda.
