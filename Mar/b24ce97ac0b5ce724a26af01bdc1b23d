 This comes after the commission invited applications for persons interested in the position on January 30, an exercise which attracted 303 applicants. Through a newspaper publication from the selection panel chairperson Arthur Osiya, the candidates will be expected to appear for interviews at the Public Service Commission (PSC) offices off Harambee Avenue in Nairobi. Michael Goa, Dr. Annettee Mbogah, Edwin Chweluget, Beatrice Meso and Dennis Mungai will be expected to appear for interviews on March 20, 2023. Mercy Smith, Long'et Terer, Beth Michoma, Prof. Morris Mbondenyi, Mercy Mathai and James Sitinei will follow on March 21. Candidates will be required to carry along their National IDs, Academic transcripts, Clearance certificates from the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA), Higher Education Loans Board (HELB), the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) and a self-declaration form stamped by the Ethics and Anti Corruption Commission (EACC). They will also need a letter of recognition from the Commission for Univeristy Education (CUE) for those who attained their degree from foreign universities. Members of the public have also been welcomed to give any credible information of interest relating to the candidates, and present them to the selection panel's chairperson. The new members of the Commission will replace the former Commissioner Naftali Rono's team, whose term ended late last year.
