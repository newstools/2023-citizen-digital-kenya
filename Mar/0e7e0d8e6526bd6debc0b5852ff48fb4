 The party's chairmen from 35 counties who had a consultative meeting with their party leader in Nairobi on Friday endorsed Azimio's Mass Action plan scheduled for next week Wednesday, saying it addresses critical concerns affecting Kenyans. "We are ready for Mass Action even now because Kenyans are suffering. We will stage it in all our 47 counties but the major one will be in Nairobi," said Philip Makabong'o, the secretary general of the  ODM chairperson's caucus. He added: "We also call for the immediate opening of the servers that will trigger electoral reforms. The ODM County caucus called for the de-listing of rebel MPs who visited President William Ruto at State House in mid-February. "We call upon NEC and all organs concerned to expedite the de-registration process of ODM members who visited State House. We remain loyal to our party leader," said Makabong'o. The county leaders called for the scrapping of the Supreme Court, citing controversial judgements during the August 9th 2022 presidential election outcome and ruling on LGBTQ rights of association. "Kenyans no longer have confidence in the Supreme court rulings...," said the Chairperson. The party leader later visited the family of the late Luo Council of Elders Chairman Ker Willis Opiyo Otondi in Kisumu County.
