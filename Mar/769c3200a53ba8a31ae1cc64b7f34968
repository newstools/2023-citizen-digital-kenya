 Korir told the MPs that land was at the center of all economic activities hence the reason it should be given an appropriate policy and budgetary allocation. “Secure access to land, sustainable land use planning and equitable distribution of land remain immensely important for food security, employment creation and the socio-economic development of the country,” the PS said during the opening of the retreat. According to Korir, his department’s mission is to improve the livelihood of Kenyans through efficient land administration, equitable access, secure tenure and sustainable management of land resources. He told the committee led by Joash Nyamache Nyamoko (MP North Mugirango) and deputized by Jayne Kihara (Naivasha), to support the department in addressing the issues of insufficient budgetary allocations for the department to provide efficient services. Another challenge, the PS noted, is the high number of litigation cases and the backlog created by the Covid-19 pandemic. Korir said his main focus is the digitisation of lands on Ardhisasa, and also compensation for land owners whose lands were used for Government projects. The joint meeting bringing together the PS, Senior ministry officials, National Assembly Committee on Lands and the NLC also provided an opportunity for groups of farmers who had grievances about leases and titles for their group ranches in Tana River. Korir assured them that President William Ruto has promised to end perennial land problems in the coast. "We have agreed with the National Lands Commission chairman Garshom Otachi that we shall set time to visit Tana River county to settle the titling of the ranches," he said.
