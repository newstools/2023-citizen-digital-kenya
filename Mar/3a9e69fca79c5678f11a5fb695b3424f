Some 150 women entrepreneurs in Kenya and Cameroon are set to
benefit from an Affirmative Fund by the Africa Development Bank, in a bid to
bridge the financial Gap for Women entrepreneurs in Africa. The regional financier on Friday launched the 'Wonder Program' under the Finance Action for Women in
Africa program, Implemented by E4Impact Foundation in Kenya. Speaking during the launch of the first cohort in Nairobi, Principal Officer Affirmative Finance Action for Women in Africa (AFAWA)
East Africa, Susan Okoh noted that AFAWA's primary objective is to bridge the
$42 billion finance gap for women entrepreneurs in Africa and unlock their
entrepreneurial capacity through training and capacity building. Okoh reiterated
that "when women win, Africa wins." She added, "when we prepare the women in technical training
and capacity building, we also create a linkage with financial institutions who
consider most small businesses risky". Fatma Elmaawy; the 2nd Vice President of Kenya National Chamber
of Commerce and Industry (KNCCI) who was among the key speakers at the event
underscored the need for collaborative efforts from both the public and private
sectors in ensuring the growth of women entrepreneurs in the country. During the launch ceremony, some of the women entrepreneurs in
the 1st cohort of the program acknowledged challenges in running their
businesses but expressed confidence that with the right support, they will
eventually change the world. As women celebrate International Women’s day this month by focusing on Embracing Equity, this comes as good news for women in a region
that has the highest number of female entrepreneurs but the least supportive
entrepreneurial frameworks. Its main aim is to enhance the sustainable development of fast-growing
economies by training impact entrepreneurs and scaling the growth of their
businesses.
