President Paul Kagame on Tuesday warned senior and local State officials who
spend the majority of their working hours in meetings he says yield nothing for national
development. Kagame was quoted by local media as saying most Rwandan public servants are mostly
holed up in meetings instead of attending to their duties.   “I have learned that some of you are always
in meetings, some of which do not even bare any results for the country, when
people try to reach you, they are told that you are in meetings and when they
attempt to try the next day, they are told the same thing,” Kagame said. “This is actually one of the excuses being
used such that you can spare time for your private affairs,” he added. According to the New Times newspaper, Kagame noted that while meetings
are important to strategise on how to serve citizens, leaders need to set aside
time for “the real work.” “This should be different from the everyday
meetings. The same time can be used for more important work,” he said, adding
that what is discussed in a meeting is not the only important thing, but also what
is achieved after the discussions. “It
should be obvious that we are lagging behind some of our goals, and this should
in part motivate our speed.” This year’s Umushyikarano was held on Monday and Tuesday after a
two-year hiatus in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. The event gave Rwandans from all walks of life the opportunity
to pose questions directly to their leaders. Chaired by President Kagame, Umushyikarano is also attended by
members of the Cabinet and Parliament, ambassadors, and Rwandese in the
diaspora, among others.  Since 2003, the event has birthed nation-building initiatives
such as Abunzi, which are mediation committees that handle disputes before they
get to court.
