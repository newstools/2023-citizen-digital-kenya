Police in Nairobi’s
Mukuru kwa Njenga slum on Wednesday arrested a man suspected to have been involved
in the death of a woman whose body was found in her house in Ruiru, Kiambu
County, last month. Christine Makena Maingi was found dead at her
residential house on February 8 after calls through her phone went unanswered. Although police were initially treating the case as suicide, investigations indicated that she might have been
killed by an unknown person. Further probe revealed that Maingi was in the
company of an unknown man on the nights of  February 5 and 6. Police said they traced and arrested a man identified
as Cristopher Kiptum Keter, aged 50, at his hideout in the slum. “The suspect was the last person who was with the
deceased person according to the CCTV footage and mobile phone communication,” authorities
said on Wednesday.  Keter is in police custody awaiting arraignment on Thursday,
March 9.
