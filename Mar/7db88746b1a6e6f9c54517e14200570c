 Five Members of the County Assembly (MCAs) of Kirinyaga have been kicked out of House committees amid fresh power struggles. Among the five MCAs relieved of the committee duties is Mutira ward MCA David Kinyua Wangui, who was the chairman of Legal Affairs and delegated county legislation and Kanyekiine Ward MCA Moses Migwi, who was a vice chairman Administration and Public Services. Kinyua is remembered for an impeachment motion filed against Kirinyaga Governor Ann Waiguru in 2020 where he accused her of gross misconduct and abuse of office before she was reinstated by the senate. “I will not keep quiet even if they remove me in the house committee. I have to fight for the people of Kirinyaga,” Kinyua said. Confirming the changes, the County Assembly majority leader Daniel Kibinga said the five MCAs were removed by committee members over indiscipline. “I can confirm to you that they have been removed no more ....' Kibinga told Citizen Digital before switched off his phone. The Five MCAs claim they were removed from the committees for opposing Waiguru’s administration. “We are 31 MCAs in the County Assembly of Kirinyaga and only 6 of us are independent and can ask hard questions against the Waiguru administration. The rest are 'yes madam’,” MCA David Mathenge said. They further claimed that the process was flawed and against the standing orders, vowing to challenge their ouster in court. “They are removing us from the committees because of attending Kirinyaga Woman rep's ceremony on Sunday at Kagumo and fighting for Kagio trader Jeremiah Njogu who is being harassed by the MCAs,” Kerugoya MCA Eric Muchina said. The MCAs who were removed from the House committees are Kinyua Wangui (Mutira), Moses Migwi (Kanyekiine) , Caroline Muriithi (Karumandi) , David Mathenge (Baragwi), Daisy Githinji (nominated).
