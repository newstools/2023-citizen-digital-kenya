Azimio One Kenya supporters in Kisumu clashed with police
officers during anti-government protests that they said were meant to make
government address the high cost of living and other ills afflicting the
country. The protesters presented their memorandum to the county
commissioner's office with their attempts to access the Kisumu State lodge
thwarted. Similar protests were
witnessed in Vihiga County as Raila Odinga and other Azimio leaders held a
series of rallies in Migori County. “Tunataka bei ya mbolea ishuke kama vile walituahidi...bei
ya unga iko juu sana,” chanted the protesters. As the protests continued, Odinga was in Uriri Constituency
to launch university scholarships at the home of Migori Senator Eddy Oketch, as
well as launch the construction of a university on climate change in Rapogi. The Azimio leader who later held a rally in Migori town
maintained that the mass action is unstoppable. “Tumesema tutafanya maandamano kila mahali.. Tarehe 20
tutakuwa huko Nairobi kwa maandamanao kubwa sana...,” said Odinga. Odinga maintained that his call for mass action will also
push for electoral reforms.
