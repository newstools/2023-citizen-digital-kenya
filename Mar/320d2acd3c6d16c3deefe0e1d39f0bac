 In videos seen by Citizen Digital, the ex-CS arrived at the premise in the company of his lawyer Danstan Omari, Rarieda MP Otiende Omolo alongside other advocates. It is however reported that the lawyers had been momentarily barred from accompanying their client into the premise until officers ascertained the identity of each member. Omari is then said to have clarified the names of each member and the team was granted access into the premise.  Former Interior CS Fred Matiang'i arrives at the DCI for questioning over the alleged police raid at his house pic.twitter.com/MV8jmMoZE5  Matiang'i had been ordered to present himself at the premise no later than 9.30 a.m. on Tuesday. He has been under probe by the DCI, questioning him over the alleged police raid at his house in February. If the summons would not be followed, the former CS would face legal action, according to the DCI. Matiangi returned to the country on Saturday after a two-week private tour in Europe to attend to private family matters. Earlier, Senior Superintendent of Police Michael Sang issued a directive compelling Matiang'i to appear at DCI headquarters on grounds that he could have published false information regarding the alleged police raid a fortnight ago but failed to honour the summon.
