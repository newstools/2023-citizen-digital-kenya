 In an unsigned but stamped communique to All Diplomatic and Consular Missions, United Nations Agencies and International Organisations, the government said the move is meant to increase efficiency. "Whereas the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations entrusts all official business with the receiving State to be conducted through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it has been agreed in the interest of efficiency, that the Missions may communicate directly with Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) of the Government of Kenya without going through Ministry of Foreign and Diaspora Affairs," reads the communique. At the same time, the dispatch said any meetings that would involve more than one ministry should be cleared by the office of Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua. "Requests of meetings cross-cutting nature and that involve more than one Ministry, it is advised that such requests should be made through the office of the Deputy President for the coordination purposes," it reads. The statement however directs that Missions can avail a report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs within three days of the meeting.
