 Speaking on Tuesday during the National Prayer Service, at the Nyayo Stadium, Mrs Ruto exuded confidence that God had heard the nation's cries regarding the ongoing drought and that the situation was about to change in no time. She even referred to the scattered afternoon clouds saying it was a sign of the answered prayers. “I know that the God that we have prayed to in the city of Nairobi today is the God that has heard our prayers, here and even in the counties,” Ruto said. “We know that the counties have been affected very much because of this drought, especially the ASAL areas... today we have prayed, we can see the clouds have formed, and we know the rains are coming. Just like the clergy has said, go and prepare your farms because the rains are coming.” The First Lady, who consequently thanked President William Ruto’s regime for holding the prayer day said the government was intimately concerned about the welfare of each of its citizens. She implored all the attendees to pray for the Kenya Kwanza administration in a bid to succeed in its plan for the nation.  “I can tell you that our president thinks about your every day, God has given him a great plan for this nation. As we continue to pray for this presidency, God is going to help them fulfil their mandate,” she stated. Her remarks come as the Kenya Meteorological Department is still insisting that hot and dry weather conditions will continue. A Tuesday weather forecast predicting the next week, ending on February 20th indicates the weather conditions remain the same. "Most parts of the country are likely to be generally sunny and dry. Average daytime (maximum) temperatures are likely to be high (more than 30oC) over most parts of the country," Met stated.
