Comedian Eric Omondi has been arrested while
leading demonstrations outside Parliament buildings in Nairobi. Omondi was leading a group of well-built,
shirtless young men in demonstrations, where they demanded the Government to
lower the cost of living. The youths donning black shorts and bare
chests had brought business around parliament to a standstill, with onlookers
milling around to watch. The police had ordered the demonstrators to
disperse, but they ignored forcing cops to use teargas. Omondi was arrested in the ensuing melee,
with the police taking him to an unknown destination. The youths were carrying placards written
"high cost of living" high cost of electricity" "stima juu,
taxi juu" among other publications. This is not the first time the comedian is leading
demonstrations at parliament grounds. In February 2022, Omondi chained himself in a cube outside parliament
buildings, with a bold placard written ‘Play 75 percent’. Then, the comedian sought the attention of parliament to debate
how local music will get at least 75 per cent of airplay in the country. He said he would be on a hunger strike and will stay there until the lawmakers debate
the matter.  Earlier, in November 2021, Omondi was arrested at the same spot
while he led demonstrations to compel parliament to enact laws on playing 75%
of Kenyan music.
