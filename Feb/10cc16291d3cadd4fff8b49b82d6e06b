Kenyan public universities still reeling from
the burden of inadequate finances are now facing yet another reality that could
further worsen their troubles. The Universities Fund now wants universities
allocated funds based not on just the number of students enrolled in the higher
institutions of learning, but on several other factors as well. The fund’s proposals will see the figure
allocated to each university take into consideration what it terms as performance-based
funding system that seeks to allocate a portion of the universities’ education
budget according to specific performance measures such as course completion,
degree completion, equity and gender considerations. The new model will be targeted at encouraging
centres of excellence and monitor the key performance indicators of the four-year
graduation rate, the graduate's employability rate, measured a year after
graduation, and the research output from individual universities. These new proposals come as the Ministry of Education
admits that things are not rosy in public universities where money is concerned. Education Cabinet
Secretary Ezekiel Machogu said: “As of now we are indebted to the tune of Ksh.56
billion, money which has accrued over the years in form of staff pension, PAYE,
NHIF, NSSF...we owe other suppliers money that we have not paid over the
years...and this figure continues to go up weekly, monthly, yearly.” The ministry now says action needs to be
taken to arrest an impending collapse of the institutions, the solutions the
ministry says include streamlining the governance structures to reduce the wage
bill. “We’re
asking universities to come up with innovative ways which they can also be able
to generate income like commercialising research...a number of them have so
much properties which is dead capital,” added CS Machogu.  The university funds recommendations will be
collated with those from the working party as the country seeks to find ways of
saving university education in the country.
