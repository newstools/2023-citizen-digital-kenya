 A commotion was witnessed at the facility on Thursday morning, after a group of men blocked Jalang’o from accessing the meeting hall. After the brief commotion, the MP was allowed in, only to be sent away minutes later. Speaking to the press after being kicked out, Jalang’o claimed that a member of Raila Odinga’s security asked him to leave the hall. “I feel bad. You know I love Baba… I am a member of ODM,” he said. The MPs predicaments has been linked to a meeting he held with President William Ruto on Monday. “I can’t regret meeting Ruto, I had gone there on my own capacity, and he called me for development issues,” Jalang’o explained. Asked on whether he would apologise for taking a different direction from his party, Jalang’o said; “There is no apology about it, I went there for development.”
