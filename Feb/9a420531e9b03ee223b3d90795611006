There are no suspicious
circumstances in the death of a Chinese teenager whose body was found near his
school last week more than 100 days after he went missing, authorities said
Thursday, ending a high-profile case that had gripped the nation. Hu
Xinyu, 15, vanished from a private high school in China’s southeastern Jiangxi
province in October. His disappearance became one
of the most discussed topics on the Chinese internet, prompting questions about
what happened to him. At
a news conference Thursday, Hu Mansong, deputy police chief of Jiangxi
province, provided detailed information on the police investigation into Hu’s
death — an unusually thorough account by the standards of Chinese authorities. He also acknowledged
shortcomings in official search operations and accepted public criticism. Authorities
had been criticized for not finding find Hu despite extensive police searches. The operations covered nearly
40 hectares (0.4 square kilometers) of woodland around the school campus,
deploying sniffer dogs, drones and thermal imaging equipment and mobilizing
thousands of people, before his body was found by a member of the public. In
recent months, baseless rumors surrounding the boy’s disappearance had run
rampant, underscoring deep public distrust in Chinese authorities – partly the
result of a lack of government transparency and years of worsening censorship.  Police
have arrested one person for spreading a video containing false information and
handed out administrative punishment to three others for spreading rumors, the
deputy police chief said Thursday.
