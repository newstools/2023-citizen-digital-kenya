A fire incident in Njuki-ini forest in Gichugu,
Kirinyaga County, on Sunday left a three-quarter-acre part of the forest in
ashes. Kenya Forest Service (KFS) head of Conservancy
in the area, Peter Ng’ang’a, said they had contained the fire by early evening. Speaking to Citizen Digital, Ng’ang’a
said the local community members extinguish the fire with the help of forest
rangers, officers from conservation groups and firefighters from the county
headquarters in Kerugoya. “We were able to contain the fire in
relatively good time. It would have been a different story altogether had it
broke at night,” he said.  No injuries were reported and the cause of the
fire had yet been established.
