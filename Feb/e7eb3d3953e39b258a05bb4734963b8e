 Nelson Twinamatsiko admitted to assaulting his female coworker Ms Anita Tumuramye after she demanded her ad commission from the latter's office. He pleaded with the court for leniency, claiming that he is a first-time offender and the breadwinner for his family. “Since the accused person has pleaded guilty to the offence and has not wasted court’s time, he is sentenced to a fine of Ksh.6,000,  in default serve a jail term of eight months,” Kanungu grade one magistrate Mr Mukobi  quoted as ruling. According to reports, the drama began when Ms Tumuramye arrived at the radio station and demanded that Mr Twinamasiko pay her commission from money paid by a regular radio client. Ms Tumuramye, the victim, said she was ready for reconciliation after the court ruling, even though the duo faced suspension from Kanungu FM, where they work, while the matter was being investigated. Kangungu FM management condemned the act and apologized to listeners and the general public in a statement issued in early February.
