Inspector
General of Police Japhet Koome has issued a statement addressing the now-viral
video of a police officer harassing a member of the public. In the
statement, Koome castigated the officer, who has since been identified, for his actions while issuing a stern warning to other
police officers not to abuse their mandate to serve and protect Kenyans. “As a
Service, we are gravely concerned by, and strongly condemn, the misconduct
displayed by the Officer. It should be clear that NPS shall not condone or
protect any officer found engaging in abuse of his/her powers and/or
privileges, or any other action that can bring disrepute to the image of the
Police,” said Koome. "We
regret the incident and reiterate that the behaviour exhibited by the said
officer does not reflect the core values of NPS, more so during this reform
where we are focused on and commitment to fostering and promoting good police-community
relations, as enshrined in the constitution of Kenya."  Koome added: Finally, we wish to inform the public that the officer has since been identified, and the incident is currently being reviewed for appropriate disciplinary action." In the video
seen by Citizen Digital, the seemingly intoxicated and armed officer can be
seen pestering a motorist, for reasons unknown, going as far as threatening to shoot him on-site. “Wewe umewahi
kugongwa?...Na hii gari na weza piga miguu yote,” said the officer while
brandishing his hand gun. The motorist
proceeds to ask the officer why he was pulled over but the policeman does not
respond. "Unaniharibia
kazi kwa nini na mimi pia natafuta?" the motorist asked. "Kwa
sababu umejifanya we ni mwanaume," the officer said in response. The motorist
then alights from the vehicle in an attempt to converse with the officer but his
effort is quickly shot down.  "Ingia
kwa hii gari na utaenda korti, mimi sikufichi," says the officer who
insisted throughout the video that the motorist disrespected him.
