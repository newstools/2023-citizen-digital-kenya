The death toll from Cyclone Freddy in Madagascar climbed to
seven on Thursday as the winds that have battered the Indian Ocean for days
started to ease before hitting Mozambique. Madagascar's government revised the death toll for the
island from five to seven on Thursday and said average wind speeds were now reaching
65 kilometres Â per hour, with gusts of up
to 90 kph. Among the victims were four
people who drowned and three killed when a house collapsed, Madagascar's
National Risk Management Office said. A
total of 78,078 people in Madagascar have been affected by the flooding caused
by the torrential rain and strong winds that began lashing the island on
Tuesday evening, with many forced to leave their homes. Forecasters
predict it will make landfall in central and southern Mozambique on Friday,
with the eye of the storm hitting the African mainland at around 1000 GMT.  Madagascar
is typically hit several times during the annual November-April storm season.
