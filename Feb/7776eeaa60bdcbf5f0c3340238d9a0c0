 In a Citizen TV interview, Kuria claimed that the alleged manufacturers were dishonestly importing raw materials through Egypt, deceiving the entire nation into thinking that the raw materials were obtained locally. The CS says this is to the disadvantage of the Kenyan economy as there are Kenyans who can comfortably provide the raw materials. “I will deal with them. I will deal with them perpendicularly. I will make the comfortable uncomfortable, and the uncomfortable comfortable,” Kuria said. He said he learned this from his Indonesian counterpart when they shared notes on trade and investment in the two countries. The CS stated that the five manufacturers should employ Kenyans in the cultivation of palm oil and other raw materials required to create edible oil without naming any specific individuals. Concerning the cost of living, especially the high prices of the edible oil, the CS blamed the manufacturers for not engaging Kenyans who growing the raw materials, saying this has escalated manufacturing as the imported raw materials are expensive. “If I do, I am damned." If I don't, I am damned. "So I choose to do,” the CS said in reference to his vow to make sure the manufacturers follow the law.
