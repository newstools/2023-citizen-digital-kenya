The Small
Claims Court will not handle cases involving people who have ‘eaten’ fare sent
to them by their loved ones, Eldoret Claims Court Magistrate Tabitha Wanjiku
Mbugua has said. Speaking during
a public engagement forum over the weekend, Mbugua said since the opening of
the court in Eldoret, some men have filed complaints of women who ‘eat’ fare
and fail to show up to dates as promised. The magistrate noted
that it is difficult for the small claims court to return the fee given to the lovers
if things go against what was expected.  "I sympathise with men who lose money to their female friends who eat fare and fail to honour invites. Some have approached my court for help but unfortunately, my court cannot compel such women to pay back the fare. The law on the jurisdiction of small claims court does not allow me to adjudicate on such," Mbugua said. Similarly, she
told Kenyans seeking help from spiritual ‘healers’ that the fees they are charged
cannot be recouped in court if the rituals fail, because the law does not recognize these healers. The Small Claims Court is
established by the Small Claims Act 2016. The court has monetary jurisdiction
over matters not exceeding Ksh.1 million.  The courts were established as part of an initiative to enhance
the ease of doing business in the country.
