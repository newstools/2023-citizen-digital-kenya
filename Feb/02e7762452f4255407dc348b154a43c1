Nominated Senator Karen Nyamu is set to appear before United
Democratic Alliance (UDA)'s Disciplinary Committee on Friday over her alleged
misconduct while at a party in December last year. The committee chaired by Charles Njenga had summoned the nominated senator in December to appear before the panel in January, saying
that the incident captured in a viral video in Dubai had brought shame to the ruling
party and injured its reputation. “In the said incident which is well captured on video
that has been widely circulated in both mainstream and social media, your
conduct and mannerism as exhibited in that incident have brought shame,
disrepute and lowered the dignity of the party which nominated you to the
office of Senator,” he wrote in a letter dated December 19, 2022. After appearing before the committee last month, the
President William Ruto-led outfit resolved to grant the lawmaker more time to
respond to the allegations levelled against her. “The senator was allowed more time to respond to the
allegations levelled against her by a party member. The committee adjourned the
matter to 9.00 am on 24th February,” UDA stated on January 20, 2022. The legislator was captured in a video that circulated
across social media platforms for the better part of the Christmas period
while engaging in a
scuffle with Mugithi Singer Samuel Muchoki (Samidoh) and his wife Edith
Nderitu.  She later
owned up to her mistake, saying she had broken up with Samidoh, who is the
father of her two children and that she had quit alcohol in 2023.
