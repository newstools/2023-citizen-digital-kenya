Democratic Republic of Congo's President Felix Tshisekedi said
on Monday that a conflict with rebels in the east of the country could disrupt
preparations for general elections scheduled for Dec. 20. Congo's electoral commission
started registering voters on Feb. 17 in North Kivu province, parts of which
are occupied by the M23 rebel group, a Tutsi-led militia that has been waging
an offensive against Congolese troops for almost a year. The
fighting has displaced hundreds of thousands of people, raising concerns about
the state's ability to prepare for the parliamentary and presidential elections
later this year. "The
persistence of the war in the east of our country risks jeopardising the
electoral process, which is already underway, due to a massive displacement of
people from combat zones, the insecurity and the inaccessibility of these
areas," Tshisekedi told the U.N. Human Rights Council session. Tshisekedi urged the international community to help Congo
restore peace and state authority in this part of the country. He again accused Rwandan
authorities of supporting the M23. Rwanda denies backing the rebels. Three Congolese and foreign
electoral experts told Reuters the electoral commission could postpone the
polls. It has already delayed the deadline for voter registration twice in more
than a dozen western provinces due to technical problems. Registration has so far been impossible in the territory under
M23 control in North Kivu, one of Congo's most populous provinces. The Congolese government has
asked the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to hold discussions
between Congo, Rwanda and the U.N. agency about repatriating refugees,
Tshisekedi added. Rwanda's President Paul Kagame
said in January that he would no longer accept refugees from Congo.  There are around 72,200
Congolese refugees in Rwanda and almost 210,000 Rwandan refugees in Congo,
according to the UNHCR.
