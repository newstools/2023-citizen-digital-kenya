Pokot South Member of Parliament David
Pkosing on Tuesday had a date with the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI)
for the fourth time in 5 days. His helicopter was at the centre of
investigations into the alleged ferrying of firearms and ammunition to bandits
in West Pokot. “It
was a follow-up of the alleged ownership of a suspected white helicopter used
to smuggle guns to bandits. DCI has since established that the MP owns one
chopper, and not an additional white one used in banditry activities…his plane
is green in colour,” his lawyer Danstan Omari said. Pkosiong on his part stated: “It's my 4th
time here. The chopper issue which was subject to forensic analysis has now been
put to rest…all those stories on why I bailed out the people is hot air.” The
ongoing operation in the banditry-affected areas is being conducted by other
security personnel on the ground. Leaders from the region however appealed to
law enforcers conducting the operation to flush out bandits but avoid
victimizing any particular community. “Let the law take its cause, let the bandits
be taken away and let the peace-loving communities stay without being
terrorized,” Kacheliba MP Titus Lotee said. Pkosing
opines that the government should come up with ways which deal with social and
economic problems affecting the people in the area such as lack of good
infrastructure as a way of ending banditry. “There was another operation done by the late
President Kibaki where you bring the KDF, it ended up building roads, bridges,
hospitals, bridges…because the problem there is social-economic," he
noted.  This
comes as heavily armed multi-security personnel including combat units from the
Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) and General Service Unit (GSU) continue mapping out
areas in 6 counties marked as troubled and high risk due to escalating banditry
activities, with 20 guns so far been surrendered.
