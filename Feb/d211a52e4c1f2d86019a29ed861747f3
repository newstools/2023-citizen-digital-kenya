The Registrar of Political Parties Ann Nderitu has brushed off Jeremiah
Kioni's questions on the legality of Jubilee’s National Executive Council (NEC)
meeting on Friday that approved his suspension as the party Secretary
General. This comes after Kioni had alleged that the NEC meeting had been held
without the members adhering to the stipulations of the law, thereby calling
for his suspension to be revoked. However, in a statement on Wednesday, Ms. Nderitu dismissed this claim, maintaining
that Kioni’s ouster was well within the party’s constitution. “This office acknowledges receipt of your letter dated February 13,
2023, on claims of an illegal Jubilee Party National Executive Council meeting
held on February 10, 2023,” wrote Ms. Nderitu. “Upon review of the documents of the NEC meeting submitted to this
office by the Deputy Secretary General, it is noted they have met the requisite
threshold of convening and holding a meeting.” The Registrar OF Political Parties, who had on Tuesday acknowledged Kioni’s ouster, cited different articles
in the party’s constitution regarding the duties of NEC members and the general
provisions of the law. The former President Uhuru Kenyatta-led Jubilee Party last week suspended
Kioni, Vice Chairperson David Murathe, as well as National Treasurer Kagwe
Gichohi over what it termed as their conduct of the political outfit’s affairs. The party’s NEC members also resolved to pull the party out of the
Azimio la Umoja One Kenya coalition party and process the modalities of
establishing a working relationship with the ruling Kenya Kwanza alliance.  The Registrar has since asked the Jubilee leadership to observe
provisions of the Azimio coalition agreement on the exit of a member party, in
strict observance of the roles of respective party organs.
