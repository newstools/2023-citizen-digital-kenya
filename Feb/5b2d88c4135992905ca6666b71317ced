Machakos County Government has today
launched a feeding program to keep ECDE children in school. Speaking while flagging off the food
distribution exercise in her office, Governor Wavinya Ndeti said 1,160 public
ECDE centres spread in the 40 wards of Machakos County will benefit from the
program. 35,000 children currently in PP1 and PP2
levels will be fed during the initiative dubbed ‘Chakula Tumboni, Masomo
Kichwani’. Wavinya said her administration had so far
spent Ksh.30 million on the school feeding program and that early childhood was
a crucial stage in a child’s physical, intellectual, emotional and social
development. “We have seen time and again how various
types of school feeding programmes boost the enrolment of children to early
childhood education. Education is an important aspect in the realization of
Vision 2030 in our country, and also in achieving my ‘Chakula Mezani, Pesa Mfukoni,’
dream for Machakos County.” “For our young children, it is ‘Chakula
Tumboni, Masomo Kichwani’ now that we all know learning on an empty stomach is
very difficult,” she added. Wavinya expressed her government’s
commitment to invest substantially in the expansion of the physical
infrastructure facilities through progressive budgetary allocations to finance
gradual construction of ECDE classrooms. She said the efforts were already bearing
fruit though they were still far from achieving their desired target of having
at least two classrooms in each ECDE facility. Additionally, her administration will set
aside an additional budget in the next financial year to facilitate the
important mission of promoting basic learning in the county.  The governor called on the National
Government, private sector, parents, well-wishers alongside other stakeholders
to join hands with her administration to ensure they facilitate better ECDE
learning programs and environment for children.
