 DP Gachagua, speaking on Sunday, claimed that government appointments and contracts are a preserve of those who voted for Kenya Kwanza government and that its staunch supporters will be rewarded and give the least consideration to members of the opposition. “This government is a company that has shares. There are owners who have the majority of shares, and those with just a few, while others do not have any. You invested in this government and you must reap. You sowed, tilled, put manure and irrigated, and now it is time to reap,” he said. Countering the eyebrow-raising sentiments by DP Gachagua, Senator Maanzo said that is apparent people from the Central and Rift Valley regions are the ones who will greatly benefit from government since the regions have the most voters and Gachagua himself hails from the same region. "Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua is very honest, they are running a company and not a government. We are heading to a situation where you want to tribalize the country. What they are saying with their mouths is not what is in the heart," he said speaking on Citizen TV's Daybreak show on Monday. "You say Kenya is free for everybody but from what he is saying is that Kenya is for two tribes; Central and Rift Valley. Anybody else does not matter." He went on to urge the government to desist from making such declarations that might cause a rift in the nation and give equitable support to Kenyans devoid of tribal backgrounds. "The constitution requires that when you win the election you embrace everybody. Like in Makueni, whoever elected me and the one who didn't does not matter. I give services to everybody equally," he said. "We must really detribalize the country for real so if you are running a company and not a government then he (Gachagua) is very honest and he is telling us what exactly they did and Kenyans should be aware what sort of rulers we have. Every Kenyan should be given an equal opportunity."
