 In their heyday as county bosses, they straddled their respective kingdoms like Colossus. They commanded big budgets to the tune of billions, their word was law; and the position was deemed a stepping stone to a presidential bid. However, for Dr Evans Kidero, James Ongwae, Moses Lenolkulal, Samuel Tunai, and John Mruttu, the question of whether the CAS position is a step down from their previous positions will undoubtedly dominate debate. John Mruttu was the pioneer governor of Taita-Taveta whose attempt at a comeback in last year’s election proved unsuccessful. Former Samburu governor Moses Lenolkulal completed his second term last year, spending his final days in office in court fighting corruption allegations. Former Kisii Governor James Ongwae also finished his second term but a few months later resigned from ODM and decamped to Kenya Kwanza in what was termed the beginning of a new working relationship with the new government. Dr.Evans Kidero, the former Governor of Nairobi, is in court contesting the election of Homa Bay governor Gladys Wanga in what seems to be a case of spreading your bets. Two time Narok governor Samuel Tunai who attempted to make a come back through the senate and lost to Ledama Ole Kina is also on the list Former governors who finished two terms are enjoying a sendoff package of  Ksh17.2M in gratuity equivalent to 31%  of their annual basic pay for the 5-year term served. Voters sent home 16 governors in the August 9 General Elections while 21 did not defend their seats after serving their second and final term in office.
