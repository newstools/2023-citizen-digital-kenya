 In her presentation, Nyamumbo sort for 350,000 USD (Ksh.44 million) for 5 % of her company adding that her kahawa 1893 coffee was the best product in the world. "I grew up on my grandfather's coffee farm in Kenya. We are very proud of the coffee that grows on our soil; unfortunately, farmers don’t always make enough for the delicious coffee that they produce. In fact, 90 per cent of the labour and coffee come from women but so many are not compensated because they do not own the land," she said. According to Nyamumbo, the lack of proper compensation for a majority of the coffee inspired her to create a way to compensate them. "We source our coffee directly from women farmers in Africa, but that’s not all, we go one step further, our customers can tip the coffee farmers and we match the tips," she said. On her website,  Nyamumbo goes deeper into her story: "My grandfather was a driver for the colonial government and managed to get his hands on some seedlings to start his own coffee farm. Growing up in a community of coffee farmers, I witnessed the inequalities within the coffee industry - women provided 90% of the labor, but didn’t own land. After studying abroad in the USA, I returned home with some ideas on how to bring Kenyan coffee to the world in a way that benefits our women farmers the most. I invite you to help me ensure that women farmers reap the rewards from their hard work." Kenyans poured praise on the budding entrepreneur with compliments.   Whereas it is still unclear whether she won over the hearts of investors or not nevertheless she stood out as one of the aspiring entrepreneurs from around the world who pitch their business models to the Shark Tank and persuade them to invest money in their idea.
