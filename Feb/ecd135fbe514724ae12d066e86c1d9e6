 The former Azimio la Umoja deputy presidential candidate claimed that the 'gangster style raid' reveals how the nation is encountering "the reign of terror worse than the dark days." Karua urged Kenyans to remain vigilant in resisting the alleged rule, noting that the rule of law must be upheld and respected. "This must be resisted by all Kenyans of goodwill. The constitution is not suspended and cannot be wished away," she wrote on Twitter. "Raiding Matiangi’s house gangster style meant to spread a cloud of terror on all persons out of favour with the UDA regime." Karua's sentiments fall on the backdrop of a myriad of sentiments from leaders in the opposition, accusing the government of being behind the incident. Opposition leader Raila Odinga, who arrived at Matiang'i's residence at around 10pm, called out the government for the incident, vowing to stand with Dr. Matiang'i. Amidst the turmoil, police Inspector General (IG) Japhet Koome has said that the operation was not conducted by police officers and none of them was sent to Matiang’i’s residence in Karen. Meanwhile, Matiang'i has moved to court seeking anticipatory bail, arguing that he is under imminent threat of arrest by the police and is justifiably apprehensive that his constitutional rights are being violated. He claims that he received credible information from officers of the Kenya Police that they are under express instructions to arbitrarily capture and arrest him with a view of arraigning him in court for ulterior political motives.
