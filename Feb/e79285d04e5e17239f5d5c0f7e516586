The Nakuru quintuplets
who were born prematurely and died less than 48 hours after were on Friday laid to
rest at the South Cemetery in Nakuru East. Family and friends
gathered at the cemetery to pay their respects to the five babies - a boy and 4 girls - who were
buried in one coffin. Their mother,
25-year-old Margaret Wairimu, was however absent as she is still recuperating
in hospital after undergoing a Cesarean Section.  The quintuplets
died on Thursday hours apart, with doctors at the Nakuru Level V Hospital saying the cause of death wasÂ  premature birth-related complications.
