Activities at the Nandi County headquarters temporarily
came to a standstill on Friday after the county askaris, together with Administration
Police officers, towed a vehicle belonging to one of the contractors who had gone
to demand overdue payment of over Ksh.8 million. Harry Kipruto said  that despite doing the renovation works at the
Nandi Governor's Stephen Sang’s office during the assumption of office period
in August last year, he still hasn’t been paid to date. Mr. Kipruto alleges that, instead, the county
government has been taking him round in a maze each time he goes to demand for
his dues, adding that this has paralyzed his ability to do any work. He also claims that the vandalization and
towing of his vehicle was meant to intimidate him and other contractors from demanding
for their dues, further asking President William Ruto to intervene in the row
between contractors and the county government. “This is just but intimidation for someone
asking for his rightful right, just asking for pay. The bitter thing is someone
staying with your money for over 8 months, over Ksh.8 million, is it right?”
Posed Mr. Kipruto.  “Naomba rais William Ruto, Governos wasikuje
kukufurahisha huko Nairobi ilhali huku nyumbani tuko na shida chungu nzima.
Hatuwezi laumu serikali kuu because ilirelease pesa...pesa ilifika hapa
jumatatu wiki iliyopita, mpaka sasa wanakandarasi hawajalipwa, imekuwa ni
harakati ya paka na panya mtu akiitisha haki yake. Tunakuomba rais uingilie
kati jambo hili”
