Chinese retail supermarket chain China Square
Limited has announced temporary closure of its shop situated at the Kenyatta
University's UniCity Mall on Sunday, February 26, 2023. The announcement by the Chinese-owned retail
shop comes a day after Trade Cabinet Secretary Moses Kuria proposed to Kenyatta
University Vice Chancellor Prof. Paul Wainaina to buy out the lease for China
Square and hand it over to traders from Gikomba, Nyamakima, Muthurwa and
Eastleigh. “We regret to inform you that China Square
Limited will be temporarily closed on Sunday, 26th February 2023. This decision
has been made to allow us to re-evaluate and replan our company strategy, in
order to better serve our customers and meet their needs. We are also
considering the possibility of cooperating with local traders to enhance our
offerings and better integrate with the community,” read the statement.  “We apologize for any inconvenience this may
cause and hope that you will understand our need to take this action. Our
commitment to providing you with the highest level of service remains as strong
as ever, and we look forward to reopening on Monday, 27th February 2023 with a
renewed focus on meeting your expectations.”
