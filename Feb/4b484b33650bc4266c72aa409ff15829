Several suspects have been
arrested in connection with Monday’s suicide bomb blast in a mosque in
Pakistan’s northern city of Peshawar that killed more than 100 people. More arrests will take place
following a major police investigation into the attack that injured another 217
people, Peshawar Police Chief Mohammad Aijaz Khan said. Authorities are also
investigating how the attacker entered the mosque, Khan added. Families that live in the
police compound where the mosque is located are being interrogated as police
cannot rule out that the attacker may have been helped by someone internally. Police suspect that 12
kilograms (26.5 pounds) of explosives were used by a suicide bomber, Inspector
General of Peshawar Police Moazim Jah Ansari said earlier. Footage emerged of the
destroyed walls of the mosque, with glass windows and paneling pummeled in the
powerful explosion. Emergency workers searched
through the rubble to locate survivors in the aftermath of the explosion, but
authorities said “mostly dead bodies” were being found. The blast Monday is indicative
of the deteriorating security situation in Peshawar, capital of the restive
Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province that borders Afghanistan and the site of frequent
attacks by the Pakistani Taliban, known as Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP). There were conflicting claims
of who was responsible for the attack, with TTP officials Sarbakaf Mohmand and
Omar Mukaram Khurasani initially saying the blast was “revenge” for the death
of TTP militant Khalid Khorasani last year. But the TTP’s main
spokesperson, Muhammad Khorasani, later denied the group was involved in the
attack. Pakistan authorities have not
confirmed either claim.  Rights groups denounced the
attack, which came at a rocky period for Pakistan amid a grueling cost of
living crisis and a faltering economy worsened by devastating floods last year.
