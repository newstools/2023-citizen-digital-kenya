 In a statement issued Saturday evening, the authority noted that the closure shall commence of Saturday, 18 and the same shall be repeated on Saturday 25. Motorists have been advised to use alternative routes during the closure including Uhuru Highway, Moi Avenue and Kenyatta Avenue. "We regret any inconvenience caused and urge members of the public to cooperate as we strive to enhance urban mobility." According to reports the footbridge was damaged by a trailer carrying an excavator about a year ago and the defunct Nairobi Metropolitan Services (NMS)  had closed it for renovation. A temporary steel structure was erected to support the bridge as construction plans for a brand-new foot bridge were said to be underway. This was followed by uproar from a few members of the public protesting over the decayed state of the footbridge, calling upon the government to take apt action to facelift the structure. "GoK's contempt for kawaida Kenyans. The footbridge over Haile Sellasie Avenue got compromised ages ago. Now pedestrians, especially @TU_Kenya students risk their lives crossing over to attend classes," Rachel M once Tweeted.
