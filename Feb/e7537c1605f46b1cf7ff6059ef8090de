 Images seen by Citizen Digital showed family members attending the faction graced by the former premier's sons, KANU Chairman Gideon Moi and Former Rongai MP Raymond Moi. Flanking them were their sisters Jeniffer, June and Doris and their brothers Philip and John-Mark. Some of the family members commemorated Mzee Moi and later headed to his resting place where they laid flowers to pay their respects. Mzee Moi died on February 4, 2020 after a long-term illness at the Nairobi Hospital. The late President Daniel arap Moi came to power in 1978 following the death of his predecessor Jomo Kenyatta. Nyayo, as he came to be popularly known, was sworn in as the second President of Kenya and ruled for 24 years. It was in 2002 that he decided to exit from politics and then through the ruling party KANU, endorsed Uhuru Kenyatta as the flag bearer for the presidential election. He remains to be a luminary in Kenya's history having etched memories into old-timer citizens who live to tell the tales of fimbo ya nyayo that he carried everywhere he went and the famous words tingiza kidole and Harambee that he often uttered to jubilant crowds during rallies.
