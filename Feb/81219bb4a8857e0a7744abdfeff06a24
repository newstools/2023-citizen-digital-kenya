The government,
through the Ministry of Water, Sanitation and Irrigation, has announced plans
to build at least three mega dams in each of the 47 counties in Kenya. This was on Friday
revealed by Water Cabinet Secretary Alice Wahome when she appeared before the Senate
committee on Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries to discuss the ministry’s major
projects, programmes, challenges, as well as legislative gaps. The CS also
decried incidents of malicious people allegedly destroying government-owned water
infrastructure in a bid to privately sell water to citizens through their own bowsers for personal gain. She hence stated
that her ministry has put in place plans to register water bowsers so as to
tackle these rising selfish water cartels. “The government
through the ministry targets to construct three mega dams per county. The
ministry will make a move to register commercial water bowsers across the
country. This will help to regulate the business,” read a statement from the
Water ministry after the Senate session. “The move is after
deliberate destruction of water infrastructure by individuals so that they can
selfishly sell the water to Kenyans through the bowsers in an overpriced way.” The statement
further added: “The ministry will move from gauging provision of water by
percentage to gauging by the number of households - a more effective way to
ensure more coverage.” CS Wahome
asked counties to develop their own water companies and ensure accountability,
also urging Kenyans to make it a habit to harvest and store water.
