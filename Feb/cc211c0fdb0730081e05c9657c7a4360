 The daring attack occurred only 60 kilometres from where Interior Cabinet Secretary Prof. Kithure Kindiki was holding a regional security meeting.  Prof. Kindiki was meeting with the Rift Valley security command to draw up a plan on how to engage the bandits, with the militia coming out to prove they were undeterred. The bandits engaged police in a fierce battle, raiding Lemeiywe village in broad daylight and drove away 60 goats after overpowering the police reservists. The attack came five days after another in Turkana where they killed one person in Lomelo. During the closed-door meeting attended by security chiefs including security heads in Baringo, West Pokot and Elgeyo Marakwet Counties, the security team planned a major operation to be mounted in the region to flush out the bandits. The CS is on Thursday expected to spearhead a charged operation to recover the goats and flush out bandits from the area.
