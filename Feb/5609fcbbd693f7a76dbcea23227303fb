The Teachers Service Commission
(TSC) has transferred six new teachers to Itumbe DOK Primary School in Kisii
County to replace the six who were interdicted on Thursday for allegedly
coercing Grade Two pupils to perform indecent acts. In six different letters dated
February 3 and penned by Nyamache Sub-County TSC director James Wanyela, teachers James Oigoro Ocharo, Wilfred Momanyi Ochenge, Florence
Nyabuto, Isaac Osoro, Morara George Igworo and Odong'a Obedi Nyanchong'i were transferred to DOK Primary School with immediate effect. Ocharo has been transferred from Giasaiga
DEB Primary School while Ochenge and Nyabuto will leave Bosana DEB Primary
School and Mosasa DOK Primary School respectively. Osoro and Igworo have likewise been
transferred from Kionduso PAG Primary School and Itibonge Primary School correspondingly
while Nyanchong'i has been posted to the school after being assigned to
Nyamache Sub-County. "Ensure you hand over all the school property in your
possession before you proceed to your new station," reads one of the
letters. "By copy of this letter, both head teachers are
required to inform this office and the secretary Teachers Service Commission of the date you are released and received at your new station through a casualty/
appointment return." The interdicted teachers; Everlyne Moraa, Angelica Joseph, Catherine
Mokaya, Moraa Nyairo, William Isuka and Gladys Kenyanya were on
Thursday found to have breached clauses
9 (1) and (c) (11) of the Third Schedule of the TSC Act, 2012 as well as
subjected the minors to psychological torture and embarrassment by sharing the
video clip of them performing the indecent acts.  TSC directed the interdicted
teachers to immediately vacate office and submit their defence responses within
21 days.
