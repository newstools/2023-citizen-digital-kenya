 Alex Ochogo, Rael Nyakerario and Pacificah Nyakerario took new pleas after the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP) requested the court to amend the charges from attempted murder to causing grievous harm to the minor. The trio pleaded not guilty. The three accused persons were charged with attempted murder on January 18 after they appeared before Resident Magistrate Christine Ogweno at the Kisii Law Courts. Prosecutor Hillary Kaino made an application to the court to amend the charges to have the three face accusations of causing grievous bodily harm according to section 4 of the penal code. The accused persons are accused of removing Baby Sagini's eyes on December 13, 2022 at Ikuruma Village, Marani sub-county, Kisii County. The boy was found abandoned in a maize farm and rushed to hospital. Kaino said that from the evidence they have gathered, it is sufficient for the accused persons to be charged with grievous harm. George Morara, appearing in Court as an interested party representing Kisii County Government, said that they are in agreement with the amendment of the charges. Morara said that witness protection agency has requested for the hearing date to be set for the witnesses to avail themselves and record statements. Resident Magistrate said that due to the weight of the case, the court appointed Moguche Violet and Kerosi Ondieki to represent the accused persons. Nduhukire Anita representing Baby Sagini supported the application. The hearing of the case will be on February 24 and March 3, 2023.
