Police in Homa Bay have arrested 11 people with forged job
appointment letters during the ongoing
County government payroll audit that seeks to weed out ghost workers who have
been illegally earning from the public coffers. The 11 suspects were arrested in a cyber café within Homa Bay town during a raid conducted by police officers and county
government officials following a tip-off from their intelligence. The suspects are being detained at the Homa Bay police
station for interrogation before their arraignment. According to the County Government Executive Committee
Member in charge of Administration, Communication and Devolution, Ms Mercy Osewe
who led the operation together with police officers, some of the workers who
do not have the required employment documents are rushing to cyber cafés to
forge their documents to secure their positions in the ongoing audit. “In the raid that happened today, 11 people were arrested
right here in Homa Bay town at a cyber café. For now, we cannot tell whether
they are county workers since investigations are ongoing,” Osewe explained. “As part of the verification, we have been vetting staff and
they need to bring different documents such as their contracts letters,
confirmation letters, promotion letters and others,” Ogutu stated.  “A number of staff, about 130, as of yesterday did not have
the necessary documents…I think today some of those who didn’t have the
documents got the idea to go and make fake documents so that they could come
and be verified to get their cheques.”
