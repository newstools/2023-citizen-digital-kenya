Eight people were
killed after a ferry and a motorised canoe collided on Lake Kivu in the eastern
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), local officials said Tuesday. Four men and four
women aboard the canoe died in the accident, which occurred on Saturday in the
port of Bukavu, the transport minister of South Kivu province, Mathieu Alimasi
Malumni, told AFP. The canoe was
leaving for Idjwi, an island in the middle of the large volcanic lake when it
collided with the Emmanuel 3, a ferry that shuttles between Bukavu and Goma,
the capital of the neighbouring North Kivu province. Alimasi said the
bodies were recovered on Tuesday. He said the canoe
was overloaded and the passengers had not been wearing life jackets. In many parts of the
DRC, people travel on waterways due to a lack of passable roads, and accidents,
typically caused by overlading, poorly maintained vessels and lax safety
standards, are common.  In one incident in
2019, around a hundred people drowned in South Kivu's Kalehe territory,
prompting President Felix Tshisekedi to declare the wearing of life jackets to
be mandatory. However, the rule is rarely respected in practice.
