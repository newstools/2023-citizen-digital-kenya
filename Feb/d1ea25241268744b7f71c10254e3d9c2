Detectives investigating the mysterious
murder of Lilian Waithera, a member of staff at the National Hospital
Insurance Fund (NHIF) have ruled out the possibility that she was accidentally
or coincidentally shot. Detectives are trying to establish the motive
of her killing by an assassin along the busy Kaunda street within the Nairobi
Central Business District (CBD) in broad daylight. Ballistic and forensic experts visited the
scene of crime as they tried to figure out the building where the assassin
fired the fatal shot from. The experts moved to the upper floors of
buildings next to where the NHIF staffer was assassinated while interrogating
tenants. According to police reports, Waithera was
shot from an elevated angle with the bullet penetrating her body through the
collarbone before stopping in the lungs; she died 5 minutes after the shooting. Investigators have ruled out the possibility
that she was accidentally or coincidentally shot, with preliminary
investigations indicating that Waithera was the target. At the time of her shooting, at around 5pm on
Monday, Waithera was walking close to her work colleague having left her place
of work in Upper Hill. What the detectives are now trying to unravel
is who wanted her dead and the motive of her assassination. Members of Waitheraâ€™s family said she did not
appear to be worried nor did she speak of threats to her life on that
particular day or before. On Wednesday, NHIF where Waithera had worked
for over 15 years, cautioned Kenyans against speculating about the mysterious
death of its staff member.  Meanwhile, ballistic experts are still
analysing the bullet head that was removed from the body of the deceased as
investigations intensify.
