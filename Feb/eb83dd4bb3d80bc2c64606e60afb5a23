A 17-year-old girl who was pronounced dead and
taken to a mortuary after a mob viciously descended on her for allegedly
stealing a bunch of bananas in Apac, Uganda was found breathing just hours
before her scheduled post-mortem. The teenager, a Matimia ward
native, was immediately rushed for treatment after doctors at Apac Hospital
made the discovery. She is currently on life
support as the institution’s doctors continue monitoring her condition. "Information was received
that she passed on after being beaten by a mob accusing her of theft,” North
Kyoga regional police spokesperson, Patrick Jimmy Okema told the Monitor. “Our officers visited the
scene, recorded statements and conveyed her body to the mortuary at the Apac
main hospital.” According to Okema, one person
has since been arrested in connection to the mob attack but police are
currently conducting investigations to rein in more suspects.  While advising members of the public not to take matters into their own hands, Okema consequently urged
persons who participated in the attack to turn themselves in before police
catch up to them.
