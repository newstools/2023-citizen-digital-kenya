Sigowet Sub-county Hospital Medical Superintendent Dr Peter
Mugun confirmed the incident saying that out of the six patients, two were
children aged 14 and 7 years while the rest were adults. Dr Mugun said the two children were in critical condition
while the four adults were stable. According to the doctor, the patients consumed the milk
which was sold by a common vendor in the area and were rushed to the hospital
after complaining of severe diarrhoea and vomiting. The Medical Superintendent revealed that the doctors at the
facility were doing all they could to stabilize the two children. He noted that already, a team of health officers has been
dispatched to the ground to collect the milk samples to be taken to a government chemist for analysis.  Kauma said one of the vehicles, an ambulance, was on standby at the facility while the other one which could have been used was out for other missions in Kericho town. Dr Mugun has attributed the contamination to poor handling of
the milk and other food items which he suspected could have not been properly
washed due to lack of water in most parts of the sub-county.  He has thus advised residents to avoid consuming foodstuffs
which are not properly cleaned so as to avoid such cases.
