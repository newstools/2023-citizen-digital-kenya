The operating licenses
of four Kenyan nurses plying their trade in Washington D.C, have been revoked
after an FBI probe determined that the quartet do not have sufficient
qualifications for licensure. Gabriel Ndung'u, Irene Waithera,
Ruth Kamau and Elizabeth Nga'ng'a,  are
part of 10 individuals who saw their accreditations invalidated by the
Washington Department of Health (WDH) following the FBI findings. The others are; Abera Yoseph, Antso Yangmotso, Okpalobi
Shirley, Tecleab Amanuel, Igwe Ijeoma and Mesele Yeshiwork. The FBI began its probe after reports emerged in January indicating that three medical schools in South Florida issued phony credentials
to over 7,600 students which allowed them to take a national test, obtain
licenses and become registered nurses. The aforesaid institutions are
Siena College, Sacred Heart International Institute and Palm Beach School of
Nursing. “In
conjunction with ongoing investigations into the legitimacy of multiple Florida-based
nursing schools, the Washington State Nursing Care Quality Assurance Commission
(NCQAC) has taken non-disciplinary action to rescind the nursing (RN) license
of the following individuals,” said WDH in a statement. NCQAC
likewise denied four applicants for RN licensure in Washington State with
academic qualifications from certain Florida-based nursing schools on the basis
of failure to prove qualifications for licensure.  "The list of NCQAC actions
to rescind licenses or deny applications associated with the Florida-based
nursing schools investigation will be updated on a weekly basis, when such
actions become final," said WDH.
