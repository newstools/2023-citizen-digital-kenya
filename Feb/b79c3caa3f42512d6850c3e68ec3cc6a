The National Assembly has adopted
supplementary budget estimates that among others rejected payment of Ksh.6
billion for the exit of Helios Investment
from the shareholding of Telkom Kenya. The Budget and Appropriation Committee,
chaired by Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro said the proposed payments were questionable
while adding that it wants investigations into how the transactions were
arrived at. "These payments were being done
just during the elections; so when other Kenyans were counting votes, others were
busy making payments elsewhere," said Nyoro "We have managed as a
committee to condense our appetite our deficit is 5.7 per cent of GDP. We must
live within our means." However, Azimio MPs poked holes in
the supplementary budget, terming it unrealistic. "Ruto said we will cut
expenditure, Kenyans expected to see a reduction...why don't we have budget
cuts?" posed John Mbadi. "We made sure as a committee
that we reach the micro-business equilibrium in this budget, I fully support
the budget," added Embakasi East MP Babu Owino. In the supplementary budget, the
office of the president has been allocated Ksh.7.3 billion which will partly clear the NMS bills.  The office of the Deputy
President got some Ksh.850 million while that of Prime Cabinet Secretary has a
spending power of Ksh.771 million.
