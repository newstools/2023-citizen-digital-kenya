 The motive behind the night security operation at the former security minister's home could not be immediately established. Citizen Digital has established that the former CS is holed up at the home accompanied by his lawyers led by Danstan Omari. Addressing the media outside the home of the former CS, lawyer Danstan Omari said Maiang'i's life was in danger, adding that they were not aware of the motive behind the intended raid on the home. "I can confirm that the life of Matiang'i is at risk. We don't know the intention of wanting to invade Matiang'i's home at this time of the night. We don't know what offence he has committed... Our client is ready to be summoned, and record a statement if they have anything to charge him with. My client is holed up as if he is a fugitive in his own country," said Omari. He added that a battery of lawyers would protect Matiang'i all through the night to ensure the security officers follow the law. "My client is holed up as if he is a fugitive in his own country. We have put a cordon in his house of more than 200 lawyers protecting our client to see the light. We will not leave here until morning so that if he is arrested we follow the law," said Omari. Opposition leader Raila Odinga, who arrived at the home of the former CS at around 10pm strongly condemned the security operation terming it "completely unacceptable." "There is no reason why police should be coming to somebody's home at this hour of the night. If Matiang'i has committed a crime warranting his arrest, that should be made public and known to him and he can present himself for interrogation," said Odinga. He added: "This idea of arresting senior citizens at this hour of the night is something that is completely repugnant to civilization. This is completely unacceptable." The team of security officers spotted at Matiang'i's home is reported to have driven away soon after the media broke the news of the operation. More to follow...
