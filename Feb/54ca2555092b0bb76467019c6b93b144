Investments, Trade and
Industry Cabinet Secretary Moses Kuria has come out to give his views on the
latest craze on Thika Road; China Square. China Square, situated
on Kenyatta University’s UniCity Mall, is a one-stop shopping hub that has
caused excitement as it stocks a wide variety of products under one roof and at
relatively affordable rates. CS Kuria, however, does not
seem all too impressed with all this hullabaloo, and presumably wants things to
change a little bit. The controversial CS, in a
tweet posted on Friday evening, said he had urged Kenyatta University Vice
Chancellor Prof. Paul Wainaina to buy out the lease for the establishment. According to Kuria, once
this is done, he wants the institution’s don to then hand over the said lease
to local traders in a bid to boost their businesses, which have presumably
suffered a hit since China Square came to town.    “I have today given an offer
to Prof Wainaina the VC Kenyatta University to buy out the lease for China
Square, Unicity Mall and hand it over to the Gikomba, Nyamakima, Muthurwa  & Eastleigh Traders Association. We
welcome Chinese investors to Kenya but as manufacturers not traders,” he
wrote.
