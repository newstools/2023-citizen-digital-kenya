 According to a statement from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) on Monday, the three men had visited Green Spot Gardens Sunday afternoon and after imbibing on a couple of drinks, they spotted the three 'mchele babes' and invited them to their table. The women identified as Hellen Wambui, 36, Irene Wairimu, 30 and Fidelis Wambui, 34 were first hesitant to the invitation but later joined the trio and continued gulping down a series of drinks. "Initially, the women pretended to be hesitant but one of the men quipped humorously Maitu, yumbukaga na kiria imeretie. (It flies with what it has swallowed)," wrote DCI. "That statement seemed to have worked the magic and the women giggled as they joined them in tearing away the marinated, juicy goat ribs and washed it down with rounds of drinks," DCI added. "The men filled with boyish excitement enjoyed their new-found company as hit song Wendo Wi Cama by popular Kikuyu musician Samidoh and Joyce Wamama rent the air, setting the mood for a happy ending." Unbeknown to the men, their drinks were laced with a stupefying substance which the women used as an advantage to woo them into falling bait to their intent. The bartender working at the eatery is then said to have noticed suspicious activities around the table the 6 were and immediately informed police officers who arrived at the premise and apprehended the three. DCI also stated that stupefying tablets were recovered from the three after conducting a search on them. The trio will be held in custody at Ruiru Police station awaiting arraignment.
