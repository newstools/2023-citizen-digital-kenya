Azimio
la Umoja One Kenya coalition party leader Raila Odinga says Kenyans should
brace for tougher economic times that will see the cost of living rise further
due to government's take over of importation role of basic commodities such as
agricultural products from the private sector. The
opposition leader, who toured Githurai accompanied by other Azimio leaders on
Friday, faulted President William Ruto's assertion that the IEBC servers were
accessible during transmission of the 2022 presidential election results at the
Bomas of Kenya. “Sasa hivi wizara ya trade ndiyo ina import sukari,
mahindi, mbolea, mafuta... Wamechukua jukumu la private sector na kwa hiyo gharama
ya maisha haiwezi shuka,2 he said. The
opposition demanded the re-introduction of food and oil subsidies, which the
previous administration used to cushion Kenyans against both internal and
external economic pressure. “Hiyo pesa ilienda wapi? Sasa Wakenya wanaumia..lazima
subsidies zirudi ili Wakenya wasiteseke,” stated Mr. Odinga. The
Azimio leaders announced that they will not relent on their mass action plans
unless prices of basic commodities drop in the next 12 days. “Hii safari si ya Azimio, ni yetu wote Wakenya ...Mkisikia
firimbi ya Raila mujitokeze,” said Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua. Mr.
Odinga reiterated his demand that IEBC servers be opened and audited by an
independent firm, faulting President Ruto's assertion that the electoral
boday's servers were accessible to all stakeholders during the transmission of
presidential results. “We have a letter here from our legal team asking
the Supreme Court to compel IEBC to open the servers,” he said. The
Azimio leader claimed that there is a plot to micro-manage the electoral body
for purposes of rigging the 2027 General Election. “We want a halt to the ongoing re-constitution of IEBC
until the issues are addressed,” he stated.  The
Azimio political outfit will hold rallies in Kakamega and Trans Nzoia counties
at the weekend.
