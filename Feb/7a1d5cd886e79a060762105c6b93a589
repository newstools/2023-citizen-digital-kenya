Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua has now turned
his guns on the media, accusing sections of the press of being sponsored by
those he described as 'milk cartels'. The deputy president who has been under siege
for declaring that the Kenya Kwanza government is a private company, reiterated
that State appointments should be reserved to those who voted for the President
William Ruto administration. DP Gachagua spoke on Thursday during the
funeral service of the late Nancy Muthoni, wife to his brother-in-law in
Gatanga, Murang’a County. “How can he pick
people who are saying his programmes cannot work to come and assist him? So,
before he can pick others, he’ll pick those ones first...na itakuwa namna hiyo,
mtaona,” he said. In an apparent reference to perceived regional
supremacy politics in Murang’a County, where Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro recently
conducted high profile political events, the deputy president accused the media
of cooking up narratives on Mt. Kenya politics. “Kama hatukuogopa
Uhuru na system na deep State, watu ya magazeti tutaogopa nyinyi? Mwache hiyo
maneno mko nayo. Mnakuja hapa Murang’a mkutano mzuri mnakoroga mnaweka uwongo,
mpaka huyu [Murang’a Senator Joe] Nyutu sasa anatoa jasho eti hakusema. Don’t
bother about these people Nyutu, forget about these characters,” he said. Murang’a Governor
Irungu Kang’ata, on his part, said: “We saw your passion when you were fighting
for this government, you even underwent personal tribulations and you stood
strongly, therefore Murang’a will give you that support.” DP Gachagua claimed sections of the media
were being sponsored to fight him by an alleged entrepreneur in the milk
business.  “Kwanza mtu ya
maziwa ndiyo analipa hii watu ya gazeti, si mnajua cartel wa maziwa? Na ni mimi
na hawa...hii watu wanaiba pesa ya maziwa, in another three months, mtaanza
kuuza maziwa mzuri,” stated the deputy president.
