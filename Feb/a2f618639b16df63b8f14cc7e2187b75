Former Mukurweini MP Kabando wa Kabando has cut
ties with former Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Alliance running mate Martha Karua's Narc Kenya party. In a series of Twitter posts on Tuesday, Kabando revealed that
he has since informed the Registrar of Political Parties of his decision to
break off from Karua's Azimio-affiliated party. While noting that he has the utmost respect for Karua and Azimio
leader Raila Odinga, Kabando added that he made the decision since he is allegedly not satisfied with the avenues Azimio is using, as the official opposition party, to keep President
William Ruto's administration in check. Kabando joined Karua's
political outfit in March 2022 in a bid to replace the then Nyeri Senator Ephraim
Maina who had set his eyes on the county's governor seat at the August 2022
polls.  He however lost the contest to
UDA's Wamatinga Wahome.
