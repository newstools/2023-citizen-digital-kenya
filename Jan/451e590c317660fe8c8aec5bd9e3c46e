 DP Gachagua claimed that he spends time with foreigners "begging for food" because he has no other choice because the country is plagued by a food shortage during a prayer visit to the Mt. Kenya Conservancy on Saturday. "Ever since I became Deputy President I've become a beggar. I spend all my time, with foreigners, begging for food. Including those who colonized us. It is very humiliating," said Gachagua. "But I have no choice because we can not let our people die. The president gave me a responsibility to mobilize food so that our people do not die and that is what I'll do." The second-in-command added that in order to resolve the nation's current crisis, he prayed to God, pleading with him for a bountiful harvest and a healed land. “We have had five failed rainy seasons and our people are staring at hunger. Our animals have died. Children cannot eat. I pray that God heals our land. I pray that God forgives our sins and heals our land so that our people can enjoy the fruits of their hard work,” he said. Gachagua expressed confidence that God had heard his prayer because he believes the mountain to be "not too far from God." “I ask many people to come here and pray because the mountain is a symbol of resilience, struggle, and victory.” The morning trek, which Gachagua defined as a "search for freedom" from the effects of a devastating drought, the threat of the erosion of generations of young men through alcohol and drug abuse.
