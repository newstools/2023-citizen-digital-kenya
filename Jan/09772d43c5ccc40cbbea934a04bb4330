Eight people from the same family, including five children,
have been killed in a car crash in eastern Algeria, the civil defence said
Saturday. The children, aged four to 13, their parents and an aunt
died after their vehicle collided late Friday with a semi-trailer near the city
of Batna, a statement said, without elaborating on the cause of the crash. In 2021, Algeria recorded nearly 22,000 traffic accidents
that killed 3,061 people and left 29,763 injured, according to the authorities.  Speed is the main cause of crashes in the North African
country, according to a government road safety agency.
