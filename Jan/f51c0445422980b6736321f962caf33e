US
First Lady Dr. Jill Biden is expected to visit Kenya in February. This is according to Foreign Affairs and Diaspora
Affairs Cabinet Secretary (CS) Dr. Alfred Mutua who made the revelation on
Citizen TV's JKLive show on Wednesday. Mutua made the announcement in response to a question
posed by show host Jeff Koinange who asked the CS whether Kenya expects to host
any high-profile dignitaries in the coming months. "Next month, we will get high-profile leaders
coming to our country. The spouse of the US president will be here in this
country," said Mutua though he did not reveal the purpose of the visit. "We will get other leaders coming to our country
in the next few months." According to Mutua, Kenya is an attractive destination
for foreign dignitaries owing to its democratic stance which provides an
environment that respects human rights and fundamental freedoms. "Kenya's place is high right now. I was invited
to the G7 as Kenya's foreign minister with other ministers because of Kenya's
place in the world and the role we are playing in the peace process because of
the democracy that we have," he said.
