 This after Azimio claimed that they have a report compiled by a whistleblower revealing that Raila won the polls by garnering 8,170,355 votes ahead of Ruto, who reportedly managed 5,919,973 votes. Speaking during a church service at Kerugoya Stadium, Kirinyaga County on Sunday, DP Gachagua cautioned Raila against causing disruptions in running the government and should leave the President to deliver on his mandate. "With these claims you are making, we know you. You want to sell fear to us so that we call you. Do not sell fear to our president," said DP Gachagua. "I want to tell you please, go look for those who supported you and leave our president alone. The president is busy and he has work to do." The second-in-command further deflated Azimio's controversial claims, arguing that Raila's move is not foreign since he has also tried the same with the previous regimes. "You have gone to look for a foreigner called Jeffrey Smith and he now has a contract with you and you tell us that he is whistleblowing. What you are doing is what you have done all the years," he noted. DP Gachagua, therefore, urged President Ruto to keep on administering his job and leave Raila to him, affirming that he will protect his leadership at whatever cost. "I urge you Mr. President, on behalf of those helping you. Leave this man to us you step aside and focus on the economy and developments. But with this man, leave him to us. We know him," he said. "One of my duties is to protect his (Ruto's) leadership and nobody will touch him." Meanwhile, the Azimio boss plans to hold a public rally at the Kamukunji Grounds on Monday to address the whistleblowerâ€™s account of the 2022 polls.
