 Confirming the incident, Marsabit County Police Commander Robinson Mboloi said about 15 bandits armed with firearms raided the village at around 6am on Thursday. The attackers are said to have opened fire killing eight people among them three children and five men. According to the police commander, the bandits made away with an unknown number of camels and goats during the dawn attack. Two of the injured were taken to Marsabit Referral Hospital while one of the victims was set to be airlifted to Nairobi for specialized treatment. A multi-agency security team has since been deployed to pursue the attackers.
