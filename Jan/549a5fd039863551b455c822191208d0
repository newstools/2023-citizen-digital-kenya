President William Ruto has challenged police officers to familiarise themselves with technological trends in
a bid to understand the evolving dynamics in the fight against crime. Speaking on Wednesday during
the recruits’ pass-out parade for Administration Police at the National Police College in Embakasi,
Nairobi, the Head of State noted that everyone in the profession needs
to acquire insights to make them understand any security threats that come with
modern technology. “The need for modernisation
arises from the constantly evolving complexity of contemporary security
challenges. Technology and globalisation have enabled antisocial characters and
criminal networks to threaten society in more dangerous ways, over a vast
international range,” said Dr Ruto. “It is important for every
police professional to rise to this challenge by acquiring insights to empower
them in understanding complicated and sophisticated criminal and security
threats and skills that enable them work effectively with modern technology and
equipment.” President Ruto noted that his
government has invested in equipping security forces with the necessary
technology to help them fight crime, such as providing the ultra-modern forensic laboratory at the DCI headquarters
in Nairobi with the required facilities. “We have increased our investment
in the provision of infrastructure,
equipment and technology for the police to improve their capacity
to combat crime and protect Kenyans and their property,” he said. “Additionally, we have
enhanced coordination between various agencies in resolving crime and security
threats, while at the same time deepening the collaboration between the police services and communities,” he
added.  Consequently, the
president urged every police officer to be mindful of the need to maintain
relations of mutual respect with members of the public to boost this collaboration.
