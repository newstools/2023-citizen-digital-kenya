Police officers in Kayole on Saturday arrested
three robbery suspects after a sting operation. According to a statement from the National
Police Service (NPS), officers based at Kayole Police Station got wind that a
man was suspected to be in possession of a firearm and was looking for
ammunition. After launching a probe, the officers
intercepted the suspect who was in the company of one accomplice in Matopeni
area while riding a motorcycle. "A quick search revealed an empty
magazine in the suspect's pocket leading to the arrest of both men," NPS stated
in a statement on Sunday. Subsequent investigations, NPS added, led to
the arrest of the third suspect who is believed to be the ammunition supplier. A pistol was also recovered from the main
suspect's house after detectives conducted a search. "After further interrogation, the
officers made the third arrest of a suspect, who was to supply ammunition to
the main suspect, and the recovery of a pistol in the first suspect's
house," added NPS. Also recovered from the suspect's house was a
black firearm dummy stashed in a shoe rack. The suspects were then escorted to the Kayole
Police Station where they will remain under custody awaiting arraignment in
court.  NPS further lauded area residents for sharing
information with police authorities noting that it will aid in getting rid of
illegal firearms in the city.
