 Odinga took to social media to acknowledge an unpleasant 2022 following the election loss and the derailing economy. He however expressed his gratitude for the New Year and hoped for a preferable 2023. “We thank God that we are able to usher in 2023 in celebrations. As we celebrate, it's also incumbent upon the nation to recalibrate. For one we've had a difficult 2022, with a hotly contested election again,” Odinga wrote on Twitter. “Living conditions were made more trying by the difficult economic circumstances that prevailed and continue as we usher in the New Year. However, I am buoyed and looking forward to a better year and times in 2023 and beyond."  Narc Kenya party leader and Odinga’s running mate in the August elections Martha Karua, echoed the same sentiments while calling on leaders to task in order to improve their performances. She at the same time implored on Kenyans to stand firm in advocating for better governance from their elected leaders. “2022 has been a tough year. The cost of living and rate of unemployment went up, and justice alluded to many. Against that backdrop, the new year appears grim. But there’s hope. Raise your voice. Fight for your rights. Challenge your leaders to do better. Happy new year!” Karua wrote.
