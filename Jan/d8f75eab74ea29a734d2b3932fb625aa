At
Siriba Primary School in Wajir South, Wajir County, makeshift tents serve as
temporary wards, for tens of residents who stream into this facility in search
of treatment. Tens
of others, who were not lucky enough to find bed space, are seeking refuge under
trees as the Cholera outbreak in this area hits one month. So
far, four people have died with 120 others admitted in various facilities
following the outbreak in the larger Wajir South constituency. A
total of 96 people are being treated for Cholera at this school, with the
waterborne disease having claimed four lives in the last two weeks. The
disease has created a public health crisis as facilities get overstretched, and
residents are now calling for quick intervention from the government as schools
are to reopen on Monday for this year’s first term. Mohammed
Rage, a resident of Siriba, told Citizen TV that they are resorting to turning
trees into care centers as health facilities continue brimming with patients. “Kumekuwa
na cholera sana ata ukiona hakuna hospitali hapa inabidi tu sasa watu wanalala
chini ya miti,” he said. All
this even as thousands others continue to flock the main well in Siriba seeking
to flee from the devastating effects of drought in the area. According
to Siriba area Assistant Chief, Ibrahim Noor, there is an urgent need of water
for not just people but livestock.

“Maji ndio shida tunahitaji water bowzer ambayo itakuwa standard kila siku
sabbau hapa maji ni one kilometre na kwa mifugo na watu haitoshi,” he said. At
the same time, Wajir South MP Mohammed Adow notes an additional need for
medical aid, including supplies and health workers.

“We need urgent help and not just in terms of medical supplies and medical
personnel but also tents for the people because a great deal of them are still
being treated outside,” Adow told Citizen TV.  Thirty-two
other patients are also being treated for cholera at a makeshift medical centre
in Biyamadhow centre in Wajir South.
