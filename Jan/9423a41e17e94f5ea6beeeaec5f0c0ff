First daughter Charlene Ruto
has joined other Kenyans in celebrating the dawn of the New Year. In her message to Kenyans,
Charlene urged locals to take their chances when they present themselves and
to accept things that they do not have the capacity to change this year, something
she says she had learn to do in 2022. "2022 taught me to
accept who I am. Accept who you are. Embrace and Love that greatness within
you, the influence you wield and the compassion you have for others. Accept
that you may not always have the answers but you are willing to take the risks
to leave your mark in this world," she tweeted on Sunday. While noting that she was
looking forward to 2023, she wished Kenyans a prosperous and successful Â year full of good tidings.  "I can't wait to
see what 2023 holds. Happy New Year. May good tidings be your potion this
entire year," she said.
