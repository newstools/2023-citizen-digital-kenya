 According to State House spokesperson Hussein Mohamed, in Paris, the President will hold talks with his French counterpart, President Emmanuel Macron, on the status of key development projects agreed upon by the two countries.  “Regional peace and security will also feature in the discussions,” said Mohamed in a statement issued on Monday. President Ruto will then travel to Dakar, Senegal, where he will be a keynote speaker at the Dakar 2 Summit on ‘Feed Africa: Food, Sovereignty and Resilience.’  The summit, organized by the Africa Development Bank, convenes at a time when Africa is experiencing serious food security challenges.  “It is, therefore, an appropriate forum for Heads of State and other partners to discuss how to exploit Africa’s agricultural potential and the plans and programmes that will help scale production," Mohamed added.  “It will also be an opportunity for leaders in the continent to find ways through which Africa can meet the rising cost of food.”
