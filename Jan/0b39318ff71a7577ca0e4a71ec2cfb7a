A boda boda operator was run over and killed by a speeding
miraa-ferrying pick-up at Ngurubani area along the Mwea-Embu Highway, Kirinyaga
County at around 1 am on Sunday morning. The boda boda operator was heading to Kiarukungu village
from Ngurubani town when he was run down by the  vehicle en route to Nairobi. The pick-up's driver is said to have attempted to overtake
another vehicle when he hit the motorcyclist who was headed in the
opposite direction. The vehicle's occupants fled the scene and did
not stop even for a moment, according to boda boda operator Kang'au Muihurwo,
who witnessed the incident. Enraged by the killing of their colleague, Muihurwo and
other boda boda operators barricaded the road in protest leaving motorists
plying the route stranded for the better part of two hours before officers from
Wanguru police station intervened and de-escalated the situation. Mwea-East Sub-County Police Commander Daniel Kitavi urged
boda boda operators  to avoid taking the
law into their own hands while insisting that police will not tolerate reckless driving in the area.  "We are going 
deal with  reckless drivers in Mwea ruthlessly," Kitavi said.
