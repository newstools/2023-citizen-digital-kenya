The National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) has dismissed rumours alleging that it has scrapped the free
maternal health care programme dubbed Linda Mama from its list of services. Former President Uhuru Kenyatta introduced the initiative
during his reign in a bid to improve access and
quality of maternal, newborn and child health care services towards attainment
of Kenya’s Vision 2030 and the Sustainable Development Agenda. In a statement dated January
2, 2023, NHIF insisted that the programme is still operational and that over 6
million women have benefited from it since its introduction. "Attention is drawn to recent false social media
messages purporting the discontinuity of the government-funded Linda Mama
program.  NHIF wishes to assure the
public that the cover is still active as mothers continue to benefit
massively," the statement reads in part. "The program, funded by the Government of Kenya,
targets expectant women and alms at reducing maternal and child deaths. In
addition, the program ensures mothers do not struggle with paying medical bills
during pregnancy and childbirth and encourages them to seek the services of a
skilled birth attendant." According to NHIF, once expectant mothers register for the
programme by dialing *155# on their phones or by downloading the 'MY NHIF' app,
their membership is activated at any clinic, once their pregnancies are
confirmed and this will see them bestowed with a one-year cover that caters for
'four antenatal visits, normal or Caesarean section delivery, three postnatal
care visits and vaccines for the child'. NHIF likewise warned Kenyans against believing anything that
they read on social media.  "The Fund, therefore, urges the public to Ignore the
false messages shared online," said the healthcare provider.
