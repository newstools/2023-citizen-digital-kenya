 Mr. Kiambi, whose mysterious death is being probed by police, was found dead on Monday morning at his home in Karen, Nairobi. In his message of condolences, Prof. Kindiki mourned the deceased as "an iconic entrepreneur who not only built an impeccable business empire but also helped inspire a generation of business people from the region and nation." "I have learnt with deep sorrow and profound sadness of the untimely death of My friend, our son Francis Kiambi Kiriiro Matanka... We will forever remember Matanka as an astute business leader whose acumen saw him establish one of the largest manufacturing industries in Kenya, employing hundreds of people directly and impacting thousands of lives,"said Kindiki in a statement issued on Monday. The Interior CS added: "We are poorer as a people without this brave and selfless leader. Matanka's leadership, towering personality and generosity will be missed by many, particularly Tharaka community among whom he had made life-changing and impactful investments." According to a police report, Mr. Francis Kiambi Kiriro’s death was reported by his wife Mary Waigwe Muthoni who told police that they returned home together with her husband at around midnight on Sunday after spending some time at an entertainment joint. The couple then reportedly got into some domestic differences after the wife allegedly declined to be her husband’s guarantor in securing a Ksh.2 billion loan he was seeking to open a business. After the disagreement, the two reportedly went ahead to sleep in different rooms, only for the 50-year-old businessman-cum-politician to be found dead with vomit on his bedside. The deceased had previously vied for the Tharaka Nithi County senatorial seat but was unsuccessful.
