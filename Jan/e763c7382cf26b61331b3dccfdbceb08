 According to Wamalwa, President William Ruto and his deputy Rigathi Gachagua have been allocating a large share of government slots to individuals hailing from their tribal backgrounds and giving the remaining few to Kenyans from other ethnic backgrounds. Wamalwa said that there is a need to have a government that equally appoints Kenyans to government positions devoid of their tribes. This he noted on Saturday while attending the burial of Prof. Richard Alex Nyabera Magoha, the younger brother to the late Education Cabinet Secretary Prof. George Magoha, at his rural home in Gem, Siaya county. "We know that there are people who have come up to say that Baba wants to start a mass action to bring chaos so that he gets invited to a handshake. We don't want a handshake what we want is to fight with tribalism," he said. "When we see President Ruto and Deputy President Gachagua alloting a large share of government to people from their tribal backgrounds and then the other half going to other Kenyans, we say that government is not what we want." The vibrant Azimio ally noted that the coalition's boss Raila Odinga will be addressing the aforesaid issues at a rally set to be held at Jacaranda grounds in Nairobi today, Sunday, January 29. "We have a big meeting in Jacaranda Nairobi to hold a national dialogue with Kenyans. We want justice for all Kenyans and that is what Raila will be addressing at Jacaranda," said Wamalwa. The meeting, Wamalwa added, will be peaceful and will be seeking to give an ear to the problems ailing Kenyans. The Azimio chief on Wednesday asked his supporters to convene at the grounds where he would give them further directions. “Jumapili ni jumapili, nataka kuona uwanja imejaa, na kisha nitawatangazia mpango mwingine,” Mr. Odinga said.
