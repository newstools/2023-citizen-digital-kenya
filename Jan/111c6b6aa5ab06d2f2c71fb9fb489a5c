Iraq has sentenced 14 people
to death by hanging for their role in the Islamic State group massacre of
hundreds of army cadets in 2014, judicial officials said Thursday. The massacre, one of the worst
committed by IS in Iraq, saw the extremists in June 2014 abduct up to 1,700
mainly Shiite cadets from the Speicher military base in the Tikrit region and
execute them. The Al-Rusafa Criminal Court
in the capital Baghdad "issued death sentences against 14 criminal
terrorists for their participation in the Camp Speicher massacre in 2014",
the judicial authority said in a statement, without specifying their nationalities. The 14 men have 30 days to
appeal the sentence. Decrees authorising executions must also be signed by the
president. In 2016, 36 men were hanged
for their participation in the massacre. The Speicher massacre took
place in the early days of the group's offensive in Iraq, when its forces
seized the second city Mosul and turned it into its stronghold -- until it was
driven out by the Iraqi army and an international coalition in 2017. According to propaganda images
released by IS, the jihadists executed the recruits one by one. Some bodies had been thrown
into the Tigris River, which runs through Tikrit, while others were buried in
mass graves. The massacre prompted a surge
of Shiite volunteers to enlist in militias fighting the jihadists. While Iraqi authorities do not
give figures, several thousand people accused or convicted of IS links are
detained in Iraqi prisons. The United Nations estimated
in 2018 that more than 12,000 Iraqi and foreign "combatants" were
being held in Iraqi prisons. Iraq has been previously
criticised for carrying out hundreds of what rights groups say are fast-track
trials using confessions obtained under torture or without proper defence.  In 2021, Iraq executed 17
people for all crimes, according to rights group Amnesty International.
