Staff at the eatery where the late prominent businessman
Francis Kiambi took a meal and drinks before retiring to him home where he was
later found dead are the latest persons of interest to record statements with
officers from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations. It is at the Big Smoke Bar and Restaurant at Karen shopping
centre where the late Kiambi arrived and spent some time alone Saturday evening
before he was joined by his wife Mary Waigwe Muthoni, and two males - an
Advocate and a relative. Those who attended to the late Kiambi, his wife Muthoni, and
the other two gentlemen say the four had a lengthy discussion until around 1 AM
when they vacated the premises located a few kilometers from the home of the
deceased businessman. Two units of DCI spent the better part of Wednesday
gathering statements from the hotel staff who attended to the deceased as well
as reviewing CCTV footage. Other than the staff at Big Smoke Bar and Restaurant, police
are also interogating the night security guards who were present at the wee
hours of Sunday, when the late Kiambi and his wife arrived home from the
outing. New security personel from the same firm have since taken
over since Monday when the deceased was found dead, more than 24 hours after he
retired to his bed. As investigations continue, relatives and friends started
flocking the late Kiambi's residence in Karen to condole with the family after
Homicide detectives completed processing the scene. According to a police report, the late Kiambi and his wife
wife Mary Waigwe Muthoni, slept in separate rooms upon arriving home, following
a disagreement reportedly caused by the wifeâ€™s refusal to guarantee her husband
a Ksh.2 billion loan he was seeking to open a business.
