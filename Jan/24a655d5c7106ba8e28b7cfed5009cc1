A
barber who sent thousands of pounds of UK pandemic business support funds to
the Islamic State group in Syria was jailed for 12 years on Thursday. Tarek
Namouz, 43, who ran a barber's shop in west London, transferred at least
£11,280 (approx. Ksh.1,660,834) between November 2020 and May 2021 to organise terror attacks
in Syria. However,
he boasted to a friend during a prison visit that he had sent £25,000 (around Ksh.3,682,941) to Yahya
Ahmed Alia, who he described as an "ex-fighter with Islamic State". Namouz
had received the money through COVID relief grants issued by his local
authority to help businesses survive during the pandemic. He
was arrested in May 2021 and denied knowing the money would be used for
terrorism, telling police he sent the funds to "help... the poor and needy
in Syria". But
Namouz was last month found guilty after a trial of eight counts of entering
into a funding arrangement for terrorism. He
was also convicted of two counts of possessing terrorist information based on
videos found on his mobile phone. Jailing
him for 12 years, with a further year on extended licence, judge Peter Lodder
said he had demonstrated a "commitment to terrorism" and planned to
"re-establish a state run in accordance with extreme Islamic
principles". Namouz
thanked the judge after he was sentenced, but in a subsequent courtroom
outburst then yelled insults at police officers present. "May
Allah destroy you. We will meet on judgment day. You're a kafir (non-believer)
and you will end up in hell," he told them. Namouz
was recalled to prison following his 2021 arrest to serve the rest of a 10-year
sentence for raping an 18-year-old woman in a north London pub where he was the
landlord in 2014.  He
had been released in September 2019 on licence.
