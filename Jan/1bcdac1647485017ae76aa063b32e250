An 11-year-old boy has died while 7 other
children are among 20 people presently admitted at the Olenguruone sub-county hospital in Kuresoi South,
Nakuru County, after consuming meat of a dead cow suspected to have been infected
with East Coast fever. Locals had feasted on the carcass after a
veterinary officer reportedly directed them to where the dead cow was buried. Village elder Joshua Langat told Citizen
Digital that the boy is said to have drank soup from the meat of the carcass. The body of the deceased has been moved to the
said facility’s morgue.  A nurse at the facility who requested for
anonymity said the other victims, including the children, are in stable condition
even as more are still being rushed there.
