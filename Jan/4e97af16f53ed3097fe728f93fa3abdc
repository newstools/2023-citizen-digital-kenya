South Sudan security agents have detained six
journalists for allegedly leaking the now viral video of President Salva Kiir
seemingly urinating on himself at an official event in December 2022. According to the Committee to Protect
Journalists (CPJ), the six journalists attached to the State-run South Sudan
Broadcasting Corporation (SSBC) are; Joval Tombe (Control Room Director),
Victor Lado (Camera Technician), camera operators Joseph Oliver, Jacob Benjamin
and Mustafa Osman as well as control room technician Cherbek Ruben. CPJ's Sub-Saharan Africa representative
Muthoki Mumo told the Guardian media outlet that the arrests mirror a “pattern
of security personnel resorting to arbitrary detention whenever officials deem
coverage unfavourable.” “Authorities should unconditionally release
these six SSBC employees and ensure that they can work without further
intimidation or threat of arrest,” Mumo said. In the video, moments before commissioning a
newly constructed road, Kiir is seen standing up for his country's national
anthem when a stain appears on his trouser before a pool slowly starts forming
at his feet. He appeared to be unaware of what was going
on despite the fact that the event was being televised live. The cameraman quickly pans away after
noticing the pool of urine. The video elicited mixed reactions on social
media with many questioning whether Kiir, 71, is still fit enough to govern
South Sudan. Others however opined that the journalists
were unethical for showcasing the elderly Head of State in such a compromising
manner. Kiir became South Sudan's president in 2011
after the nation gained its independence from Sudan following a referendum. He
has led the nation, which has yet to hold any elections, since then.  The people of South Sudan are however
expected to take to the ballot in 2024.
