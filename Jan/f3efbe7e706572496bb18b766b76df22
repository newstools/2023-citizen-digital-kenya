President William
Ruto has now revealed that he fired former Directorate of Criminal
Investigations (DCI) boss George Kinoti. This comes in contrast
to President Ruto’s own announcement on September 27, 2022 that the DCI boss
had tendered his resignation. The President, speaking
during a joint interview at State House on Wednesday, disclosed that he relieved
Kinoti of his duties for overseeing a team accused of multiple extrajudicial
killings. The Head of State also
added that he has since tasked the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA)
with probing and getting to the bottom of the said killings with the aim of
bringing the perpetrators to book. “I had a thorough
meeting with IPOA and we have agreed that it is not necessary for us to
establish another taskforce when IPOA is there and it is squarely within their
mandate to tell us how Kenyans ended up being killed in this manner and it was
business as usual,” he stated.  “Thirty bodies in
Yala, 17 in Garissa, there was a container here at Nairobi area where people
were being slaughtered, in a police station…how did we
end up there? What kind of rogue institution was that? And that is why I fired
that Kinoti man, because it’s not right.There will be responsibility.”
