A butcher died while trying to
slaughter a pig in Hong Kong on Friday, the city’s police said. The
61-year-old butcher, who worked in the Sheung Shui Slaughterhouse on the city’s
northern outskirts close to its border with mainland China, was knocked to the
ground by the struggling pig and sustained a wound from a 40 centimeter (15
inch) meat cleaver, police told CNN. The butcher had been about to kill the pig – which he had already shot with an
electric stun gun – when it regained consciousness and knocked him over, police
said. A colleague found the man
unconscious with the cleaver in his hand and a wound on his left foot, police
said. He was taken to hospital and was later certified dead. The
police force said the cause of death has yet to be determined. The
city’s Labour Department said it has launched an investigation. “The
Labour Department is saddened by the death of the person and expresses its
deepest sympathy to his family,” it said in a statement. “We
will complete the investigation as soon as possible to identify the cause of
the accident, ascertain the liability of the duty holders and recommend
improvement measures,” a department spokesman said. "We will take actions
pursuant to the law if there is any violation of the work safety legislation."  The
city’s Food and Environmental Hygiene Department, which manages livestock
slaughterhouses, offered its condolences to the man’s family in a statement.
