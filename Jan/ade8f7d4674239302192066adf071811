The government
will invest at least Ksh.5 billion from capitation kitty to set up laboratories
in Junior Secondary School (JSS). Education Principal
Secretary Belio Kipsang says this is in an effort to ensure adequate
infrastructure amid reassuring parents that there are sufficient learning materials for the 1.2 million learners transitioning to the Competency-Based
Curriculum. Speaking on
Monday at Arap Moi Primary School in Kajiado when he monitored the JSS learners' reporting, Kipsang said education stakeholders should work hand in hand
to prepare the learners to choose pathways in senior secondary school level. He further
urged parents to stop panicking over the transition, saying it was only meant
to monitor and assess learnersâ€™ progress.  Kipsang said
that the ministry of education is closely working with Members of parliament to
urge them to also utilise part of the NG-CDF money in improving schools
infrastructure.
