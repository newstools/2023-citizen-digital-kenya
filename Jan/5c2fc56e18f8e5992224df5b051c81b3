 The report, compiled in conjunction with the Mo Ibrahim Foundation (MIF), defines governance as the provision of the political, social, economic, and environmental goods and services that every citizen has the right to expect from their State, and that a State has the responsibility to deliver to its citizens. According to the report, which provides an annual assessment of the quality of governance in African countries, Kenya has shown an absolute change in its good governance score since the last analysis was conducted in 2012 when Kenya was ranked 17th. The survey constitutes a framework for citizens, governments, institutions, academics and businesses to assess the delivery of public goods and services, and policy outcomes, across Africa. The report reveals that Kenya has recorded a steady improvement in laying Economic Opportunity foundations, an exemplary improvement in Hunam Development and Inclusion but is increasingly deteriorating in having Security and Rule of law. Kenya comes in after Rwanda and São Tomé and Príncipe which came in 12th and 11th respectively. Mauritius tops the list followed by Seychelles, Tunisia, Cape Verde, Botswana, South Africa, Ghana, Namibia, Senegal and Morocco. The Ibrahim Index of African Governance (IIAG) however notes that eight countries, Burkina Faso, Eswatini, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Madagascar, Namibia and Rwanda, have reverted to a negative trajectory or halted progress completely, registering warning signs. Out of the 54 African countries, Gambia is said to have recorded the largest improvement while Libya has recorded the largest deterioration. South Sudan Ranks last on the list.
