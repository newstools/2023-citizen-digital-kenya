A 28-year-old man died by suicide on Monday morning after
hanging himself in his home in Mwea, Kirinyaga County over yet to be
established reasons. Area residents say that the body of the deceased was found
hanging on the rafters of his house by children, playing in the same compound as the man's residence,
who had gone to say hello to him. The children then raised alarm attracting the attention of
other residents within the vicinity who were baffled as to why the young man
took his own life despite the fact that he was allegedly in good spirits during
the festive season. The body of the deceased has since been moved to Kibugi
funeral home pending post mortem according to Mwea West Sub-County Police
Commander Wilson Koskei. Residents of Kirinyaga, have in recent months, decried the
high number of men taking their own lives in the region. On December 31, for instance, Thiba residents were left
perplexed after the body of a 59-year-old-man was found dangling atop a tree
near a local rice farm. The deceased, according to friends and family, did not
outright say that he would commit suicide but he reportedly told them, on more
than one occasion, that he would not see the New Year.  "I thought it was a joke because during his final days,
he spent a considerable amount of time near the tree we found his body dangling
from. Little did I know that he would take his life at the same spot. I think
he looking for a good site to commit suicide," Samuel Migwi Kariuki, the
deceased's brother, told Citizen Digital.
