A 76-year-old woman is
in custody after fatally shooting her terminally ill husband in the head in
what police say was an intended murder-suicide at a hospital in Daytona Beach,
Florida, on Saturday. The terminally ill man, 77, was hospitalized at the
Advent Health Hospital and made a plan with his wife three weeks ago to “end
it” should his health get worse, Daytona Beach Police Chief Jakari E. Young
said in a news conference. Police did not specify the man’s illness. The man intended to turn the gun on himself but was
physically too weak to do so, police said. His wife, who intended to take her
own life after, said she “couldn’t go through with it,” according to Young. Officers responded to the hospital shortly after 11:30
a.m. and hostage negotiators made contact with the woman, whose identity hasn’t
been released. She was taken into police custody at approximately 3 p.m., Young
said. Keeping other patients on the 11th floor, where the
situation took place, was a “logistical nightmare” as many patients were on
ventilators and could not be easily evacuated, he added. The woman is in custody
and could be awaiting a first-degree murder charge, according to Young. It’s unclear how the woman entered the hospital with a
gun and if the hospital had a metal detection security system. The exact gun
used in the shooting also remains unclear. There is no longer a
police presence at the hospital, according to Young. Dr. Joshua Horenstein, a cardiologist at Advent Health
Hospital, was working in the emergency department when he learned of the
shooting incident. “Someone came in screaming in the emergency department
that this was not a drill and to shelter in place,” Horenstein told CNN while
hiding in a supply room with a nurse.  Horenstein said he was finally able to leave the supply
room after roughly 90 minutes.
