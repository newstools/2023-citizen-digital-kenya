 The suspect identified as Florence Karakacha is reported to have beaten up her husband, Bramwel Lubanga, and even ripped off part of her lip over claims that he had married a second wife. The woman, a mother of five, is then said to have set the house on fire before rushing to the nearby Ematiha Police Station, claiming that it was her husband who had attacked her. Police would then arrest the man before later receiving the actual information on what transpired from the womanâ€™s son Rayton Lubanga and the neighbours. According to family members, the man married a second after he found out that she was engaging in an affair with his brother. Confirming the incident, Navakholo OCPD Richard Omanga said the woman is in police custody pending arraignment.
