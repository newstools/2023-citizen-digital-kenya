The government has suspended the
construction of any new stadium across the country with immediate effect. Sports and Youths Affairs Cabinet Secretary
Ababu Namwamba on Saturday announced that the move is aimed at coming up with a
concrete plan to construct and improve all stadia infrastructures to
international standards. “We have suspended construction of all
sporting infrastructure. We want to come up with standards and a master plan first.
When we start construction, they will be above standards,” Namwamba said. Speaking in Budalangi during the launch of
Kenya Innovation Week to impact digital skills to youths, the CS also revealed
that plans to launch "Talanta Hela" programme are at an advanced
stage. He urged Youths to acquire digital
literacy, to obtain full benefits from the technological space. “We want you to be able to use your phones
and laptops to access opportunities and to innovate. We want you to innovate in
science and you will get support through the Kenya National Innovation Agency,”
he added.  Namwamba said the Kenya National Innovation
Agency will be working with 184 youth empowerment centres in Kenya, to turn
them into digital hubs.
