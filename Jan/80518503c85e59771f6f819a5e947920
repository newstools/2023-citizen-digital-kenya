  The anti-graft body is investigating
the alleged irregular extension of the term of office of Zipporah Sintoya Gad,
whose non-renewable six-year term expired in August 2019, following her
assumption of office in August 2013 as the Secretary to the County Public
Service Board.

EACC says Gad’s term is indicated in her appointment letter dated 8th August
2013, signed by Interim County Secretary Stella Langat on the same date.

Gad’s contract was irregularly extended by three months from 8th August 2019 to
November 2019 by then County Secretary Elizabeth Loichoki.

The commission says the latest five year extension with effective from 11th of
May 2020 to 7th of August 2026 is illegal.

Section 58(1)(c) and (4)(a) of the County Governments Act 2012, provides that
members of County Public Service Boards, including the Board Secretaries, shall
hold office for a non-renewable period of 6 years.

The inquiry by EACC comes a fortnight after its report ranked Narok County as
the most likely to be asked for a bribe in order to get services. The survey found that service seekers
paid the highest average bribe of 42,652 shillings in Narok.  The County is also on EACC's radar for
allegations of procurement irregularities in the award of tender for revenue
collection at Maasai Mara Game Reserve.
