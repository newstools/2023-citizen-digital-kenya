Police in
Nairobi are investigating the mysterious death of a businessman who was found
dead at his home in Karen, Nairobi on Monday morning. According
to a police report on the incident, Mr. Francis Kiambi Kiriro’s death was reported by his wife Mary Waigwe Muthoni who told police that they returned home
together with her husband at around midnight after spending some time at an
entertainment joint at Karen shopping centre. The couple
then reportedly got into some domestic differences after the wife allegedly
declined to be her husband’s guarantor in securing a Ksh.2 billion loan he was
seeking to open a business. After the disagreement,
the two reportedly went ahead to sleep in different rooms, only for the 50-year-old businessman-cum-politician to be found dead with vomit on his bedside. “They
each spent the night in different rooms and the deceased never woke up since
then, but could be heard snoring throughout the day and night and had vomited
in his bedroom. It was
until today at around 0600hrs when she went to check on the deceased and she
found him lying dead on his bed with
some vomits beside the bed,”
reads the police report. “They
called a doctor from the Karen
hospital who confirmed the death at around 0902 hrs.” According
to police who visited the scene, the businessman’s body, which has since been
moved to Lee Funeral Home, had no visible injuries.  Nairobi Regional Police Commander Adamson Bungei has confirmed that investigations
into the incident are ongoing.
