A
Kisii man accused of killing his two
daughters in cold blood is mentally competent to stand trial, a
psychological evaluation conducted on him on Wednesday revealed. Nelson
Ontita was arrested in Kiobegi area of Nyamache sub-county last week after his
wife discovered the bodies of the deceased, aged 10 months and two years,
dumped in a maize plantation adjacent to her residence. The
children had been left in the care of their patriarch on the day of their demise. Prosecution
counsel Ian Mukusi asked Ogembo Law Courts to hold the suspect, who had been
arrested under a miscellaneous application, for 14 more days to allow
for further investigations. According
to Mukusi, investigators have since taken statements from a number of witnesses
including the suspect's parents and have sent out a panga and a blood-stained
trouser as well as a pair of sandals recovered from the suspected murder scene
for forensic testing in Kisumu. The
forensic experts have also collected DNA samples from under the fingernails of
the two children to establish whether they match those of the suspect. According
to Mukusi, the prosecution intends to drop the initial miscellaneous charge
leveled against Ontinta for murder. The
move is however subject to approval by the Office of the Director of Public
Prosecutions (ODPP).  The
case will be heard on January 23, 2022.
