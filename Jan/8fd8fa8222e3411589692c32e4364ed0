A 30-year-old woman from Suna West, Migori
County has been arrested in connection to the death of her 15-year-old son who reportedly
succumbed to injuries inflicted on him by his matriarch on the night of New
Year's Day. The woman, whose name has been withheld, was
apprehended by police on Tuesday evening after neighbours discovered her son's
lifeless body. According to Migori County Police Commander
Mark Wanjala, the suspect, a Migori-based businesswoman, left her house on
Tuesday morning believing that her son, a form two student at Abwao Secondary
School, was sleeping off the beating he received the previous night. She was visibly surprised to learn of his
death according to Wanjala who added that police are yet to establish the boy's
cause of death but they suspect that he succumbed to the aforementioned
injuries since his body had visible signs of abrasions. Police have also began a manhunt for the boy's
brother, 25, who is alleged to have also partaken in the fatal beating of his
juvenile sibling.    The woman is currently being held at Oruba
Police Station and is set to be arraigned in court while the deceased's body
has been moved to Migori Level IV Hospital for storage pending postmortem
as investigations into the incident continue.
