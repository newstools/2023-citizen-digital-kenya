 DP Gachagua said during a thanksgiving service at Nanyuki stadium in Nanyuki on Sunday that the illustrious reception follows tradition's dictates on how leaders should be welcomed to the region. "We are planning to take our leader to the mountain for his homecoming to Mt.Kenya because there is a traditional way of how we receive our kings. And we shall receive you as a king because you are one," said Gachagua. The second-in-command went on to add that the service will be preceded by a long trail set to start in Githurai, Nairobi and end at the Sagana State Lodge which is located at the foothills of Mt. Kenya. He noted that they will at some point make a stop at River Chania to make a prayer before proceeding with the journey. "The journey will start in Githurai, we come to Ruiru, Juja then when we arrive in River Chania we stop and make a prayer. We then proceed up to Kenol we pass by Maragua, Murang'a, Sagana, Kagio, Kutus, Kerugoya, Kagumo, Kiangai, Karatina, Nyeri, Chaka, and we finish at State Lodge Sagana," said Gachagua. "That is where we will do a thanksgiving service for the Mt. Kenya people then we do a meeting with leaders in Sagana 1 we discuss on how we can develop this region." DP Gachagua further narrated details of his Saturday's visit to the Mt Kenya Conservancy saying that he had gone to pray for President Ruto so that he tackles the current challenges facing the nation with ease. "You even saw me the other day going to Mt. Kenya at 5 a.m. I prayed for Ruto because we want God to give him grace, and courage because Kenya is facing alot of problems," said Gachagua. During his morning trek, Gachagua noted that "this mountain has a healing effect on people" as he also seeked to retrace a journey that was made decades ago by his parents.
