Kilifi County. The
boat was carrying 28 passengers including 15 foreign tourists on Saturday
afternoon. According
to witnesses, the boat was hit by a strong wave and capsized leaving the three,
including a five-year-old who was on holiday with his parents from Nairobi, and two other residents of Watamu dead. “Tunasikitika
kwa mkasa uliotupata leo hapa Watamu...ilikuwa boat ya Smokeline ambayo ilikua
imebeba wageni,” Ali Bakar, a resident, said. Kenya
Wildlife Service (KWS) officers and Watamu Marine National Park and Reserve
Warden arrived at the scene on a search and rescue mission. Two bodies had been
retrieved by Saturday evening. Those
rescued are reported to be in stable condition as a search operation for the
third person is underway. The

ni kuwa unapotokea mkasa wa aina hii, haupatikani usaidizi wa haraka,” Swaleh
Ali, another resident, stated.
