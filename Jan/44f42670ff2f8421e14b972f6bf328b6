Police in Kuria West, Migori
County are currently on the hunt for a known suspect said to have stabbed a senior
police officer inside a local entertainment joint on Sunday night. According to Kuria West
Sub-County Police Commander Cleti Kimaiyo, the officer-in-charge of Masaba
Police Post made his way to Apple Bar in Masaba Centre after receiving word from
concerned revelers that the suspect was publicly brandishing a machete and a
knife inside the pub. As the officer attempted to
disarm the man, the suspect reportedly let go of his machete, reached for his knife
and stabbed the police man in his right upper thigh before disappearing into the
night. Kimaiyo says that the officer,
who was bleeding profusely, was rushed to Masaba Medical Centre and was
discharged after treatment.  The suspect remains currently at
large.
