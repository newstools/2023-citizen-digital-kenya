The volume of water in Lake Ol Bolossat in
Nyandarua County has dropped at an alarming rate to almost nil. The ongoing drought is at the heart of it,
with failed rains for consecutive seasons. The Kenya Meteorological Department (KMD) says
Kenyans should brace for two long months of severe heat, with temperatures
remaining abnormally high until the last week of March. The weatherman says that while temperatures
are unusually high, the current state borders on heat wave. Dr. Richard Muita, the
Assistant Director of Climate Services at KMD, says: “The
conditions that we are experiencing now also hinge towards getting heat wave,
but heat waves are normally localized kind of events, so it can only happen in
specific areas.” The weatherman says that for far-flung
counties like Garissa, Wajir, Mandera, Isiolo and Marsabit counties that have
recorded temperatures as high as 40℃, the drought situation will worsen. “We
expect the impacts of the current drought to continue in the coming months. And
if the March-May rains will not be as good, then it means it will even become
worse,” adds Dr. Muita. The Met. department attributes the current warmer
than normal situation to La Nina condition, the periodic cooling of ocean
surface temperatures in the Central and East-Central Equatorial Pacific. “La
Nina is a phenomenon that occurs across the Pacific Ocean, and it has impact
across the whole globe. And when you have La Nina like conditions, in parts of
Horn of Africa, East Africa, Kenya included, you are likely to experience more
drier conditions than wetter conditions,” states Dr. Muita. The warning by the weatherman comes on the
backdrop of ravaging drought in 25 counties listed by the National Drought and
Management Authority (NDMA) in its January 2023 drought bulletin.  According to Deputy President Rigathi
Gachagua, the government has set aside Ksh.2 billion for immediate drought
response in the country.
