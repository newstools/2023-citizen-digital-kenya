Police
in Uasin Gishu County have arrested three more people in connection with the
gruesome murder of fashion designer and LGBTQ rights activist Edwin
Chiloba. Chiloba’s
body was discovered stuffed in a metallic box in Kipkenyo, Eldoret, on Wednesday afternoon. According
to eyewitness accounts, unknown assailants drop off the metallic box along the
Kipkenyo - Katinga road before speeding off. Police
on Friday said they had arrested one suspect, a freelance photographer
said to be a Chiloba’s boyfriend, in connection with the murder. On
Sunday, detectives said the three more suspects were a cousin
to the main suspect, a friend and a taxi driver, whom they believe aided in the
disposal of the body. They added
that they had also impounded the vehicle used to dispose the fashion designer’s
body. Preliminary
investigations have since revealed that Chiloba’s eye was gouged out and he had
other injuries. An
autopsy was conducted on the body on Friday and police say the four suspects
are aiding in investigations. Chiloba was a fourth-year student at the
University of Eldoret who had carved a niche for himself as a model and fashion
designer.  His death has sparked public
outcry, with human rights organisations condemning the incident and calling
for speedy investigations.
