The High Court in Kabarnet, Baringo County, on Friday sentenced
a Chief to 40 years in prison after he was found guilty of defiling a minor. Kasaka sub-location Administrator Thomas Chesang, 47, was accused
of intentionally and unlawfully defiling the 14-year-old girl on diverse dates between
February and August 2021. He was charged with a second count of committing an indecent
act with a child contrary to Section 11 ( 1) of the Sexual Act Number 3 of
2006. Senior Resident Magistrate Caroline Ateya convicted Chesang of
a felony saying he had a higher moral responsibility but failed when he defiled
and impregnated the Class Seven pupil. While making the ruling, Magistrate Ateya jailed the Chief saying
the sentence will act as a deterrent to others.  The magistrate further noted that the underage girl is
vulnerable and, following the heinous act, was affected mentally.
