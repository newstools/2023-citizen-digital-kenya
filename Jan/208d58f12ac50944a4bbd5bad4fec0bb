A body of an unknown man was retrieved from the waters of
River Yala in Bondo, Siaya County on Thursday evening. The John Doe was discovered at around 6:00 pm by a family that was searching for their missing kin who reportedly drowned in the river a
few weeks ago. Got Agulu sub-location chief Joseph Owigo told Citizen
Digital that the body, which appeared to be heavily built and of medium height,
had deep cuts on the shoulder and a leg that was almost severed. The man's body has since been moved to
Got Afulu Sub-County Hospital Mortuary pending postmortem and identification as local police commence investigations into
the incident.  Members of the public, who may have also lost their
relatives under unclear circumstances, have been urged to visit the morgue
to verify if the deceased could be one of their kin. The
incident comes seven months after close to 30 bodies, suspected to be victims of extra-judicial killings, were discovered in the river. A significant
number of them are yet to be identified according to police.
