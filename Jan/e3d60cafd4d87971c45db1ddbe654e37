 The CS met with the Coordination Council for Recruitment Companies ( CCRC) on the first day of the labour migration mission. Concerns were raised about some Saudi Arabia agencies operating in Kenya using proxies, inadequate response to distress cases, contract substitution by some employers and agencies, and confiscation of travel documents by some agencies among other issues currently facing Kenyan labourers in Saudi. The Government has already negotiated four Bilateral labour Agreements with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is key in labor migration as just in the year 2022, more than 80,000 domestic workers were able to secure employment. The Cabinet secretary and the Kenyan delegation had a bilateral meeting with the Minister of Human Resource and Social Development Eng. Ahmed bin Sulaiman Al Rajh. Their talks focused on existing opportunities for strengthening labour migration systems among the two countries, including understanding the labour migration policy and legal context in Saudi Arabia. CS Bore also visited the Embassy of Philippines which is among the leaders in sending migrant workers to Saudi Arabia. Labour migration plays a significant role in economic growth and other countries see the Philippines as a model for regulating migration. In 2021, Kenya with USD 3.7 billion in diaspora remittances was one of the top four highest remittance-recipient countries in Africa.  The Cabinet Secretary says she is in the process of streamlining the labor migration in order to create more secure jobs.
