Nakuru County government has dissolved the
Naivasha Level 4 hospital board due to poor governance and failure to
oversight the facility’s management. The board was sent packing following an
outcry from members of the public over the provision of services in the debt-ridden
hospital. The dissolution came hours after area
residents held a demonstration outside the hospital to protest the death of a
woman after excessive bleeding hours after giving birth. On Tuesday, irate residents blocked the
road leading to the facility to protest the death of 23-year-old Rebecca
Wangari who had been admitted to the facility for three days. While issuing the directive, the County
Secretary Dr Samuel Mwaura said that this was part of restructuring the
hospital that serves over 1,000 people every day. He admitted that the hospital faced tens of
challenges including staff and medical shortage which had affected service delivery. He said the county was keen to address it by employing
more staff and providing the required drugs and equipment. The County Secretary added that a team had
been formed to investigate alleged cases of maternal deaths with promise to
take necessary action. According to him, the hospital had a debt
of Sh250m owed to suppliers, making it impossible to offer the required
services. Mwaura further noted that the failure to
promote the medical personnel since 2015 had affected staff morale adding that
this would be addressed in the next one month. On drug shortage, he said that the count
first procured drugs worth Sh48m adding that another batch of Sh100m was on the
way to address the current shortage in public hospitals.  Viwandani MCA Mwangi Muraya welcomed the
move to send the board packing noting that this was part of the measures put in
place to improve service delivery in the public hospital.
