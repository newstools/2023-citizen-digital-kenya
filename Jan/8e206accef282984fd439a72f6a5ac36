Police in Kisumu County have commenced investigations into various
incidents that have seen a number of Kenya Railways' trains get pelted with
stones at Muhoroni area along the Kisumu-Nairobi rail line. According to Evans Getembe, the officer in charge of Kisumu
Railways Police Station, railroad officials have reported that stones have
been hurled at their trains on three different occasions, damaging windows while
endangering the lives of travelers. The latest incident, Gatembe went on, happened on Sunday,
January 1, between Koru and Kibigori but no passenger was injured during the
occurrence. The incidents, Gatembe added, have all occurred at dawn as
the trains snake along Muhoroni towards Kisumu. He said that police have intensified night patrols in a bid
to nab the perpetrators of the uncouth incidents while underscoring that police
will not tolerate the vandalising and sabotaging of the country's economic
assets.  In December, 2022, Transport Cabinet Secretary ordered Kenya
Railways to increase the frequency of trains ferrying passengers and goods on the
route to help to reduce road congestion during the festive season.
