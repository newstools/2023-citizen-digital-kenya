A court has ordered that tissue samples be collected
from the body of the late former Commissioner General
of Kenya Prisons Isaiah Mosiori Osugo for purposes of DNA testing in a
pending paternity dispute. This after a woman
identified as Julia Kamuyu Kamuiru came forward following news of Mr. Osugo’s death last week, claiming to have sired two children with him. Ms. Kamuiru went to court
seeking an order for DNA specimen samples to be obtained form the body of the
deceased, which is currently being preserved at the Lee Funeral Home, before his burial slated for January 20, 2023. The court directed the Kisii Level Five Hospital
CEO to collect the samples, adding that in the event of failure then the issue
of DNA shall be considered in any other forum including succession court. Ms. Kamuiru had also, under a certificate of urgemcy, sought orders to delay the burial until “the DNA specimen sample of
the deceased is taken and preserved for purposes of DNA examination”; this
prayer was however denied. She further wanted the two children she claims
to have sired with the deceased to be allowed to attend the funeral at his home
in Kisii County. Mr. Osugo died at around 7 p.m. on
January 9, 2023 while undergoing treatment at the Nairobi Hospital where he was
battling Cancer. According to reports, he had previously
sought treatment in India but his condition still worsened. The deceased was appointed to the correctional
department as the Commissioner General of Prisons in 2008 by late president
Mwai Kibaki from his previous post as the Nairobi Provincial Criminal
Investigations Department (CID) chief.  His tenure at the department ended
on  March 19, 2019, paving way for his successor Wycliffe Ogalo.
