A Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) officer was on Friday sentenced
to five years and eight months in prison after being found guilty of
recruitment malpractices. Major Ibrahim Juma Wasike was found guilty of two counts, in a sentencing carried out by
a court martial sitting at Lang’ata Barracks comprising
senior military officers and presided over by Makadara Law
Courts Principal Magistrate Agnes Wahito. “The first count is
committing a civil offence contrary to section 133 (1) (b) of the KDF Act,
obtaining by false pretence contrary to section 313 of the penal code. Major
Wasike on this count was convicted of colluding with one Job Lukale Maina alias
Joseph Adiedo Mola to obtain Ksh.100,000 in cash from Mr.
Colley Njeru in the false pretense that he was in a position to recruit Mr.
Kevin Gitonga Munene into the KDF during the February 2021 recruitment
exercise,” KDF said in a statement. “On the second count, the
accused was convicted of colluding with Job Lukale Maina alias Joseph Adiedo
Mola for obtaining from Mr. Colley Njeru Ksh.60,263 via

that he was in a position to recruit Mr. Kevin Gitonga Munene into the KDF
during the February 2021 recruitment exercise.”  Major Wasike was granted 21 days to appeal
the sentence of two years and ten months on each count which shall run concurrently.
