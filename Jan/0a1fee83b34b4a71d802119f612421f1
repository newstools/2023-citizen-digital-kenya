It is at a garage situated along Park Road in Pangani, Nairobi County, where a Toyota Ractis saloon car that was captured on
CCTV being used by a chicken theft syndicate was impounded by a joint police
operation involving DCI officers from
Kiserian, Runda and Pangani police stations. The car, whose registration number is KCE 780R, and which is currently
being detained at the Pangani Police Station, was positively identified by a
mechanic as the vehicle highlighted by Citizen TV in the ‘Chicken Heist’ story which aired in
late December. The mechanic then informed
the police as the vehicle was undergoing a color paint
transformation from it's original silver to white color. Upon searching the details
of the vehicle on the NTSA owner identifier TIMS, the motor vehicle
which was registered in September 2015 belongs to Peter Michuki Ngarega. Citizen TV immediately reached out to
Michuki Ngarega on telephone, and he acknowledged ownership of the vehicle but
said; “niko pahali hatuwezi ongea.” More details regarding the
mastermind of the chicken theft syndicate have emerged, with the identity of
the female gang leader earlier indicated as Susan Kamau, being a forgery. Police investigations have
revealed that the female gang leader stole the identity
card of Susan Wanjiru Kamau in October 2018, at Ruiru, Kiambu County, and registered several numbers using it. Susan Wanjiru Kamau, a house
help based in Ruiru, has told police
investigating the heist that she reported the ID theft incident at the Ruiru
Police Station before obtaining an abstract for a renewal. Detectives are also
following leads indicating that the female gang leader has been residing at
Tinganga village in Kiambu County, before fleeing
to Nyeri after Citizen TV exposed the syndicate.  It’s
also in Tinganga where one of the victims was conned Ksh.160,000. The suspect and her accomplices are still on the run.
